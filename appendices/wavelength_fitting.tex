\chapter{Multi-detector wavelength calibration} % Main appendix title
\label{appendix:wavelength_fitting}

An example of multi-detector wavelength calibration is provided here.
This is an idea to improve the wavelength calibration on the detectors in which a limited number of telluric lines fall.

The spectrum recorded across the four {CRIRES} detectors is created from a single dispersion and should, in theory, be able to be modelled by a single polynomial.
\cref{fig:multidectorfit} shows the pixel-wavelength calibration points for the four detectors, along with the individual detector fits extended over all detectors.
At this scale all four lines are basically similar except for the fourth detector fit (pink) near the first detector where the wavelengths are higher.
On top of the four individual fits is also a black line indicating a polynomial fit made using the points from all detectors incorporating fixed detector gaps.

\cref{fig:multidectorfitdiff} shows the difference between the individual detector fits and the combined fit.
Within the individual detectors the absolute wavelength difference to the combined fit is small.
It is worst at the edges of detector \#1 with a maximum difference of 0.05\nm{}, however the differences exceed 0.3\nm{} outside of the original detector.
The differences are quadratic in shape as the individual fits are quadratic hence their differences are also quadratic.

\end{figure}

The combined fit is made by first assigning each horizontal pixel of each detector the position between 0 and 4095 in pixel coordinates of the {CRIRES} detectors.
A transformation is made into a pseudo-physical pixel coordinates from the left edge of the first detector by including the gaps between the detectors (in pixels).
The parameters \(gap_{1}\), \(gap_{2}\), \(gap_{3}\) are the three gaps between neighbouring detectors gaps and are defined in pixel space as follows:
\[
gap =\begin{cases}
0,                       & ~~~~0=<pxl<1024\\
gap_1,                    & 1024=<pxl<2048\\
gap_1 + gap_2,             & 2048=<pxl<3072\\
gap_1 + gap_2 + gap_3,      & 3072=<pxl<4096
\end{cases}
\]


This example does not include the height on the detectors that the spectrum falls or any skewness of the spectrum to pixel rows or any miss-alignment between the detectors.
All which could have some affect on a global wavelength calibration.

The pixel widths of these gaps can be fixed to known values (e.g.\ 282, 278, and 275 pixels~\citep{brogi_rotation_2016}) as done in \cref{fig:multidectorfit} or allowed to vary and included in the fitting process.

To explore this the same pixels-wavelength points from all detectors are fitted with a second and third order polynomial that includes variable or fixed gaps.
\cref{tab:example_calibration_parameters} shows the fit parameters obtained as well as some fit statistics.

\cref{fig:quadcornerplots} also show the distribution of the fit parameters for the quadratic fit with fixed (left) and variable gaps (right). These were distributions were obtained using the \textit{emcee} \Python{} package\footnote{\href{http://dfm.io/emcee/current/}{http://dfm.io/emcee/current/}}, which performs a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation over the parameter space.
The shapes of the cloud of points reveal correlations between different parameters.
For instance the narrow diagonals indicate a strong correlation between the parameters given on the axis.
There are strong correlations between the quadratic parameters, {q, m, b} with $m$ being negatively correlated to all other parameters.
It also shows strong positive correlations between the variable detector gaps.

The correlations between the polynomial parameters with either fix or variable gaps are almost identical. 
These are the plot on the left and the top three rows of the right hand plot.

This is just a simple representation of the idea.
It has not been pursued further and was not used in this thesis for the wavelength calibration.
