As mentioned in \sref{subsubsec:reductionartefacts} there were artefacts observed from the optimal reduction of the {DRACS} pipeline. A list of all specific nods of each observation and detector that were observed to contain artefacts and were replaced with the method developed are provided in \tref{tab:nod_replacement}.

With 8 nods per observation, and 4 detectors for the 17 observation there are 544 individual nod spectra. \tref{tab:nod_replacement} identifies 79 individual nods that contain artefacts which is 14.5\%. Only 16/68 (23.5\%) detector observations have nods without any artefacts and no single observation has no artefacts in any nod spectra across the 4 detectors.

In \tref{tab:nod_artefact_tally} a tally is provided of the frequency of artefacts occurring within each nod in the nod cycle. There is a higher number of artefacts occurring in the last two nod, indicating that there may be something to do with the length of the observation. \todo{Is this significant??}.
There is also a larger number of artefacts occurring on the second detector. This maybe coincidence as it is easier to identify the artefacts with a low number of spectral lines from the target, or possibly something physical to do with detector 2. This is beyond the scope of this work, \todo{is detector two significant as well?}

In this appendix we also provide more example images of the artefacts observed from the optimal reduction of the {DRACS} pipeline. We have selected one observation and detector for each observed target to show a variety of the artefacts observed.

In each image the top panel contains the 8 nod spectra extracted using the optimal method, including variance weighting. The middle panel contains the rectangular extraction (sum of the aperture), including the bad pixels.

It is clear that the large extracted artefacts occur due to single spikes observed in the rectangular extraction. What is unclear is why it only occurs some of the time.

summary of exmaples::: they show...  almost random big and large spikes but not all.

     \caption{Artefact example for the second detector of {HD\,4747}.  The top panel contains the eight normalized nod spectra obtained using optimal extraction. The middle panel shows nod spectra using only rectangular extraction. The bottom panel shows the difference between a combined spectrum using optimal nods only and a combined spectrum in which the identified nods are replaced with their rectangular counterparts as per \sref{subsubsec:reductionartefacts}. A vertical offset is included between each spectra for clarity. The nod spectra are in observation order from top to bottom. In this example there are artefacts in the \nth{5} (purple) and eighth (grey) nod spectra around 700 and 500 pixels respectively.}

In this example two large spikes around 800 and 1000 in the \nth{7} nod (pink) create large deviations in the optimally reduced spectra. A spike in the first nod (blue) around pixel 700 also causes a bump. There is also some extra noise in the first nod around pixel 350.}
