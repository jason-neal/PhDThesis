\subsection{Calculation of expected {RV}}
\label{subsec:expected_RV_calc}
Before the differential subtraction method is presented, calculations are performed to estimate the {RV} of both components in each observation and the likely separation between the companions between observations.
The time of each observation is used as input into \cref{eqn:rv_equation} combined with the orbital parameters from \cref{tab:orbitparams} to calculate the expected {RV} of the host star.
These values calculated are provided in \cref{tab:observations} as \({RV}_{1}\).
The companion mass (\Mtwo{} or \Mtwosini{}) is used alongside the stellar mass from \cref{tab:star_params} to calculate the {RV} of the companion (see \cref{subsec:binary_mass_ratio}).
This is given as \({RV}_{2}\) in \cref{tab:observations}.
The {RV} difference between the host and companion for each observation is also computed and provided as \({rv}_{2} = {RV}_{2}-{RV}_{1}\) (although this will not be used until \cref{cha:model_comparison}).

For these observations the maximum estimated {RV} separation between the two companion spectra in \(\Delta {RV}\) is calculated following \cref{eqn:companion_difference} below and provided in \cref{tab:estimated_rv}.
This table also contains the estimated semi-major {RV} amplitude for the companion \(K_2\) (from \cref{eqn:q_ratio_K2}) and the phase coverage of the observations.
The phase coverage is the maximum fraction of the orbit covered between the observations for each target.
For {HD\,4747} the \(\Delta {RV}\) and phase coverage values are missing due to the single observation.


\input{tables/direct_recovery/estimated_rv}
%\input{tables/old/flux_calculations} % This is the old table.

The full orbital solution for the components along with the times of observations are displayed later in \cref{sec:orbtial_diagrams}.
