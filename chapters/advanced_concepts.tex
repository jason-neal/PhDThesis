\subsection{RV calculation}
\unfinished{Move location / adjust from paper}
To determine the RV offset to apply to the simulated spectra above we calculated the RV of the companion using the published orbital parameters of the host, transforming the RV semi-amplitude of the host \(K_{1}\) into the companion semi-amplitude \(K_{2}\) using the mass ratio,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:mass_ratio}
q = \textrm{M}_{2} / \textrm{M}_{1} = \textrm{K}_{1} / \textrm{K}_{2}
\end{equation}

We note that for the targets in which only the minimum mass (\(\textrm{M}\sin{i} \)) is known, this equation will indicate the maximum \(K_2\) value for the companion. The estimated \(K_2\) value for each companion is given in Table~\ref{tab:flux_table} while the estimated RV for each observation is calculated in Table~\ref{tab:observations}.

If a direct measurement of the companion RV or \(\Delta RV\) from the differential spectra analysis was achieved, then this relation would have been used to calculate the companion mass.

The error on estimated RV values is calculated using the general error propagation formula~\citep{ku_notes_1966} with the RV equation and the errors on the orbital parameters. For a function, \(f\), with errors on the inputs \(\delta x\), \(\delta y\) etc, it follows:
\begin{align}
f &= f(x, y, z, ...)\\
\delta f &= \sqrt{{\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \delta x\right)}^2 +  {\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \delta y\right)}^2 + {\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \delta z\right)}^2 + ...}
\end{align}

\subsection{Telluric models}

Utilizing telluric models has been shown to be better than the standard star method.
\subsubsection{TAPAS}

\subsection{Tapas models}
\todo{ADAPT THis section to explain the models more generally. Move the usage back to Reduction section}
\label{subsec:tapas_models}
For the wavelength calibration and telluric correction methods we use telluric line models. These have been show to provide as good or better telluric correction compared to the telluric standard method \reference{telluric model correction methods original}and \citep{ulmer-moll_telluric_2018}.

We utilized the TAPAS (Transmissions of the AtmosPhere for AStronomical data) web-service\footnote{\url{http://www.pole-ether.fr/tapas/}}~\citep{bertaux_tapas_2014} to obtain atmospheric transmission models for each observation. TAPAS uses the standard line-by-line radiative transfer model code LBLRTM~\citep{clough_linebyline_1995} along with the 2008 HITRAN spectroscopic database~\citep{rothman_hitran_2009} and Arletty atmospheric profiles derived using meteorological measurements from the ETHER data center\footnote{\url{http://www.pole-ether.fr}} to create telluric line models.

The Arletty atmospheric profiles have a 6 hour resolution, so there may be a slight difference between the actual profile at the time of observation.

We use the mid-observation time to retrieve transmission models for each observation, with the Arletty atmospheric profiles\footnote{Nearest of the 6 hourly profiles} and vacuum wavelengths selected. The telluric models were retrieved without any barycentric correction to keep the telluric lines at a radial velocity of zero with respect to the instrument.

TAPAS allows for the choice of atmospheric constituents included in the model spectra. We obtained one model with all available species present, convolved to a resolution of \(\rm R=50\,000 \), and another two models without an instrumental profile convolution applied. For these two extra models, one contained only the transmission spectra of \(\rm H_{2}O \) while the other contained all other constituents except \(\rm H_{2}O \). This was to explore a known issue with the depth of \(\rm H_{2}O \) absorption lines in the TAPAS~\citet{bertaux_tapas_2014}. \sref{subsec:telluric_correction}.

Using TAPAS is contrasted alongside Molecfit and Telfit in~\cite{ulmer-moll_telluric_2018}. We conclude that \ldots



\subsubsection{Vacuum wavelengths}

Wavelength transformation---reasons we didn't

Vacuum wavelengths are requested and used in this work.
We chose to stay in vacuum wavelengths.

correction comes from refractive index of air which changes with pressure and temperature of air.

There are a number of conversions for converting between atmospheric wavelengths and vacuum wavelengths for optical and NIR spectra, the most recent one --- which includes the \nir{} only valid up to 1.7\um{}...
Therefore we did not use it. \unfinished{Fix up this}

Does having the detector in a vacuum chamber affect this/mean it vacuum wavelengths already???
