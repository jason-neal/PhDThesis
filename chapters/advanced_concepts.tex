\subsection{RV calculation}
\unfinished{Move location / adjust from paper}
To determine the RV offset to apply to the simulated spectra above we calculated the RV of the companion using the published orbital parameters of the host, transforming the RV semi-amplitude of the host \(K_{1}\) into the companion semi-amplitude \(K_{2}\) using the mass ratio,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:mass_ratio}
q = \textrm{M}_{2} / \textrm{M}_{1} = \textrm{K}_{1} / \textrm{K}_{2}
\end{equation}

We note that for the targets in which only the minimum mass (\(\textrm{M}\sin{i}\)) is known, this equation will indicate the maximum \(K_2\) value for the companion. The estimated \(K_2\) value for each companion is given in Table~\ref{tab:flux_table} while the estimated RV for each observation is calculated in Table~\ref{tab:observations}.

If a direct measurement of the companion RV or \(\Delta RV\) from the differential spectra analysis was achieved, then this relation would have been used to calculate the companion mass.

The error on estimated RV values is calculated using the general error propagation formula~\citep{ku_notes_1966} with the RV equation and the errors on the orbital parameters. For a function, \(f\), with errors on the inputs \(\delta x\), \(\delta y\) etc, it follows:
\begin{align}
f &= f(x, y, z, \ldots)\\
\delta f &= \sqrt{{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \delta x\right)}^2 +  {\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \delta y\right)}^2 + {\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \delta z\right)}^2 + \ldots}
\end{align}

\subsection{Telluric models}

Utilizing telluric models has been shown to be better than the standard star method.
\subsubsection{TAPAS}

\subsection{Tapas models}
\todo{ADAPT THis section to explain the models more generally. Move the usage back to Reduction section}
\label{subsec:tapas_models}
For the wavelength calibration and telluric correction methods we use telluric line models. These have been show to provide as good or better telluric correction compared to the telluric standard method \reference{telluric model correction methods original}and~\citep{ulmer-moll_telluric_2018}.

We utilized the TAPAS (Transmissions of the AtmosPhere for AStronomical data) web-service\footnote{\url{http://www.pole-ether.fr/tapas/}}~\citep{bertaux_tapas_2014} to obtain atmospheric transmission models for each observation. TAPAS uses the standard line-by-line radiative transfer model code LBLRTM~\citep{clough_linebyline_1995} along with the 2008 HITRAN spectroscopic database~\citep{rothman_hitran_2009} and Arletty atmospheric profiles derived using meteorological measurements from the ETHER data center\footnote{\url{http://www.pole-ether.fr}} to create telluric line models.

The Arletty atmospheric profiles have a 6 hour resolution, so there may be a slight difference between the actual profile at the time of observation.

We use the mid-observation time to retrieve transmission models for each observation, with the Arletty atmospheric profiles\footnote{Nearest of the 6 hourly profiles} and vacuum wavelengths selected. The telluric models were retrieved without any barycentric correction to keep the telluric lines at a radial velocity of zero with respect to the instrument.

TAPAS allows for the choice of atmospheric constituents included in the model spectra. We obtained one model with all available species present, convolved to a resolution of \(\rm R=50\,000\), and another two models without an instrumental profile convolution applied. For these two extra models, one contained only the transmission spectra of \(\rm H_{2}O\)while the other contained all other constituents except \(\rm H_{2}O\). This was to explore a known issue with the depth of \(\rm H_{2}O\)absorption lines in the TAPAS~\citet{bertaux_tapas_2014}. \sref{subsec:telluric_correction}.

\subsubsection{Vacuum wavelengths}
\todo{a good reference that mentions the uv and optical uses could be good?}
Astronomical light is refracted as it enters Earths atmosphere, as it changes medium from the vacuum of space and to air . The index of refraction, \(n\), is the factor at which the velocity, \(v\), and wavelength \(\lambda\) of electromagnetic radiation changes from their values in a vacuum.
\begin{equation}
n  = \frac{\lambda_{vac}}{\lambda_{air}}, \frac{v_{vac}}{v_{air}}
\end{equation}

The index of refraction of air is very close to 1, but has a complex wavelength dependence which also depends on atmospheric composition (e.g. \(\rm CO_2, H_2O\)), temperature and pressure.
There are several empirical formula for the index of refraction of air \citep[e.g.][]{edlen_dispersion_1953, peck_dispersion_1972, ciddor_refractive_1996}. As an example the refractive index given by \citet{ciddor_refractive_1996}, based on optical and infrared measurements and valid up to 1.7\si{\micro\meter}, is:

\begin{equation}
    n -1 = \frac{0.05792105}{238.0185 - \lambda^{-2}} + \frac{0.00167917}{57.362 - \lambda^{-2}}.
\end{equation}

This is measured at starndard air, dry air at 15\si{\degreeCelsius}, 101.325\ \si{\kilo\pascal} and with 450\,ppm \(CO_2\).
Beyond 1.7\ \si{\micro\meter} there are only theoretical models of the refractive index of air, due to lack of experimental data. For example ~\citet{mathar_refractive_2007} provides theoretical values between 1.3 to 24\ \si{\micro\meter} for common air pressure and temperature of ground-based observatories.

In this work we extensively use spectral wavelengths specified in a vacuum. The first is because the empirical relations are not valid beyond 1.7\ \si{\micro\meter}, while the CRIRES spectra we investigate are observed around 2.1\ \si{\micro\meter} and the CRIRES instrument manual provides all measurements in vacuum wavelengths.

The TAPAS synthetic transmission models~\citet{bertaux_tapas_2014} we use for telluric correction are available for download in vacuum wavelengths or air wavelengths\footnote{The wavenumber, \(1/\lambda\), is also available.}. The PHOENIX-ACES library of synthetic spectra we use also provides spectra in vacuum wavelengths.
Since both are available in vacuum wavelengths and the TAPAS models are used for calibration, vacuum wavelength exclusively, With this there is no errors introduced from conversions between air and vacuum wavelengths.
