\subsection{Companion K}
\label{sec:companion_RV}
\emph{These sections might be unnecessary}\\

To calculate the RV of the companion at the time of each observation. For a two-body system the RV semi-amplitude of the companion $\textrm{K}_{2}$ can be determined from the orbital host-companion mass ratio $q = \textrm{M}_{1}/\textrm{M}_{2} = \textrm{K}_{2}/\textrm{K}_{1}$.
Note, that for the targets in which only the minimum mass (msini) is known, this will give the maximum RV semi-amplitude of the companion.
This relation was used to estimate $\textrm{K}_2$ for the companion from the minimum mass or mass we have for each companion. These values along with the other orbital parameters of the system were use to calculate the RV of the companions for each observation. These values are provided with the observations in Table~\ref{tab:observations}.


\subsection{Companion-host Flux ratio}
The companion-host flux or contrast ratio of the systems are calculated using $ \frac{F_{2}}{F_{1}} \approx 2.512^{m_1-m_2} $, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnitude of the host and companion respectively.\ $m_1$ is the observed magnitude of the host while $m_2$ is obtained from stellar evolution models of \citet{baraffe_evolutionary_2003, baraffe_new_2015}, using the companion mass or minimum mass and the host age. The models, interpolated to the companion mass, also provide a first estimate of companion properties such as $T_{eff}$, $R/R_{\odot}$ and the magnitude in many wavelength bands.
We use the K band magnitude specifically for this work to estimate the flux ratio between the host and companion using and the host K band magnitude obtained from SIMBAD \citep{wenger_simbad_2000}. Our flux ratio estimates are presented in table~\ref{tab:flux_table}.

If only the companion minimum mass is known then this will correspond to the flux ratio lower limit, (or worst case scenario).


A simple tool to do this calculation was created with python. Given a host name, companion mass and a stellar age it can give a flux contrast ratio of the system. A script to work backwards from a flux-ratio to a companion mass was also created as a check for the results from \S~\ref{subsec:companion_recovery}. These scripts can be found at \url{https://github.com/jason-neal/baraffe_tables}.

\subsection{CRIRES data}
\label{subsec:CRIRES}
Observations were performed with the CRIRES instrument~\citep{kaeufl_crires_2004} configured to observe a narrow wavelength domain of the K-band between \(\rm2120-2160~nm \) using the Ks and the Hx5e-2 filters. The slit width of \(0.4\sec \) resulted in an instrumental resolving power of R\(\sim50000 \), with no adaptive optics to ensure that the slit was entirely covered by each target.

The observations were performed in service mode during period 89 with run ID.~089.C-0977(A) between April and August 2012. An observation is composed of 8 individual spectra with an integration time of 180 seconds, observed in the ABBAABBA nod cycle pattern to obtain a high (>100) signal-to-noise when combined. The targets and observation times taken by CRIRES are provided in Table~\ref{tab:observations}.




TAPAS XML REQUESTER

Although TAPAS provides a convenient web-interface to retrieve telluric spectra, it is tedious to use when requesting many models. A script\footnote{Can be found at \url{github.com/separate repo}} was used to automatically fill-out the XML template provided by TAPAS directly from values in the header information of each observation. Although created for these CRIRES observations it could be adjusted to work with other instruments if many TAPAS spectra are required. \textbf{It can be found at \ldots. Make separate Github repo for TAPAS requests.}
