\chapter{Separating the spectra of faint companions} % Main chapter title
\label{cha:direct_recovery}

This chapter focuses on applying a direct subtraction method to near-infrared (\nir{}) spectra of {FGK} stars which have Brown Dwarf (BD) companions, with the goal to isolate the spectrum of the companions and determine their mass from the radial velocity difference.
The data used was obtained with the {CRIRES} instrument in 2012\footnote{Before this thesis began} observed with the purpose to apply the differential technique specifically.
A level of trust was placed in the quality of the observations, which was unfortunately misplaced.
This chapter begins by presenting a range of spectral separation techniques, followed by the motivation for the specific targets observed and details about the observations obtained.
The direct subtraction technique is presented and its application to the observations is explored.
The limits of the differential technique at low {RV} separations is given by simulation with synthetic spectra.

\section{Summary}
This chapter presented the observations that were gathered having in mind the application of a differential subtraction method to recover the spectra of the faint {BD} companions.
Due to the poorly separated observation times relative to the long orbital periods, the differential subtraction method presented in \cref{sec:direct-subtraction} was revealed to be inappropriate for these observations as the {RV} separation of the companion spectra between observations is significantly smaller than the width of individual spectral lines.
The small separation of the companion causes the lines of the companion to also mutually cancel, severely reducing the residual signal to well below the available noise level.
The requirement of well separated {RV}s for the companion spectra was clearly stated in the original proposal but was not satisfied by the observations, however the very large orbital periods of some of the targets would not produce a sufficient {RV} signal during one semester was possibly and oversight during the proposal stage.
In the following chapter a different technique will be explored in the attempt to extract details of the companion from these observations which were insufficient to apply the differential.
