\chapter{Separating the spectra of faint companions} % Main chapter title
\label{cha:direct_recovery}

Spectral observations of binary systems contain the spectra of both bodies, in proportion to their flux ratio, and Doppler shifted relative to each other due to their orbital motion.
There many different techniques to disentangle the spectra of binary objects.
This chapter focuses on applying a direct subtraction method to near-infrared (\nir{}) spectra of {FGK} stars which have Brown Dwarf (BD) companions, with the goal to isolate the spectrum of the companions.
The data used was obtained with the {CRIRES} instrument in 2012\footnote{Before this thesis began} observed with the purpose to apply the differential technique specifically.
A level of trust was placed in the quality of the observations, which was unfortunately misplaced.
This chapter begins with the motivation for these specific targets and details the observations obtained.
The direct subtraction technique will be presented and its application to the observations will explored.
The limits of the differential technique at low {RV} separations is given by simulation with synthetic spectra.

\section{Direct recovery in the \mir{}}
It was investigated if this differential technique could be extended into the mid-infrared {\mir{}} domain.
There were two reasons for this: to develop experience with the {\mir{}} domain where the contrast ratios are higher, and due to the lack of high-resolution \nir{} spectrographs available at the time (see \cref{subsec:new_generation}).

{VISIR} is a \mir{} spectrograph on the {VLT}, offering diffraction-limited imaging at high sensitivity in three mid-infrared (\mir) atmospheric windows: the \emph{M}-band at 5\um{}, the \emph{N}-band between 8--13\um{} and the \emph{Q}-band between 17--20\um{}, respectively.
The use of {VISIR} to detect the spectra of Brown Dwarf companions in the {\mir{}} was briefly explored.
The candidate selected as the best target to investigate was {HD\,219828} which has a hot-Neptune (\Mtwosini{}=21\Mearth)~\citep{melo_new_2007} and a recently discovered super Jupiter (\Mtwosini{}=15.1\,\Mjup) on a long period (13 yr) eccentric orbit (e=0.81)\citep{santos_extreme_2016}.

Based on the spectra of a cool brown dwarfs in the \mir{}, and the detector configuration available at the time, the best option for the observations was the low resolution mode covering the wavelength region 8--13\um{}.
This wavelength region would have encompassed the \ce{NH4} signature at 10.5\um{} and the edge of a \ce{CH4} band at 7.7\um{}, both large features in the {BD} \mir{} spectrum.

After performing flux ratio calculations between the host and companion using the~\citet{baraffe_evolutionary_2003} models (see \cref{subsec:compaion_flux_ratio}) and considering the performance of the {VISIR} instrument and the exposure time calculator it was determined that observations with {VISIR} to achieve a \snr{} of 100 were infeasible, requiring 1000's of hours of observing time to achieve the necessary signal-to-noise level to separate the companion from a blended spectra.
For a different target, {HD\,189733} it was calculated that with an exposure time 2 hours the \snr{} of the host and companion would be 85 and 4 respectively, using the low resolution spectroscopy mode.
As such the direct separation approach was not explored further in the \mir{}.


\section{Summary}
This chapter presented the observations that were gathered having in mind the application of a differential subtraction method to recover the spectra of the faint {BD} companions.
Due to the poorly separated observation times relative to the long orbital periods, the differential subtraction method presented in \cref{sec:direct-subtraction} was revealed to be inappropriate for these observations as the {RV} separation of the companion spectra between observations is significantly smaller than the width of individual spectral lines.
The small separation of the companion causes the lines of the companion to also mutually cancel, severely reducing the residual signal to well below the available noise level.
The requirement of well separated {RV}s for the companion spectra was clearly stated in the original proposal but was not satisfied by the observations, however the very large orbital periods of some of the targets would not produce a sufficient {RV} signal during one semester was possibly and oversight during the proposal stage.
In the following chapter a different technique will be explored in the attempt to extract details of the companion from these observations which were insufficient to apply the differential.
