\chapter{Fundamental concepts about spectroscopy and RV}
\label{cha:concepts}

In this chapter the basics of \nir{} will be presented and a derivation of the of the RV equation. Following that details about the synthetic spectral models used in the work are provided. Synthetic stellar spectra {PHOENIX-ACES} and {BT-Settl} as well as atmopsheric spectra using {TAPAS}.
