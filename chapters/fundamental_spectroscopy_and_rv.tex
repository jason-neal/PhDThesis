\chapter{Fundamental concepts about spectroscopy and RV}
\label{cha:concepts}

In this chapter the basics of \nir{} will be presented and a derivation of the of the RV equation. Following that details about the synthetic spectral models used in the work are provided. Synthetic stellar spectra {PHOENIX-ACES} and {BT-Settl} as well as atmopsheric spectra using {TAPAS}.

\subsection{Differential techniques}
\todo{maybe this should go in differential chapter}
See \citet{kostogryz_spectral_2013} for lots of useful references regarding differential works \citet{simon_disentangling_1994}

\citet{rodler_weighing_2012} uses differential of a series of phases to construct a stellar mask for the host to subtract from all measurements.
