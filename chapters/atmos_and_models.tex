\chapter{Atmospheres and Models}
\label{cha:atmospheres_and_models}

This chapter focuses on atmospheres, primarily the atmosphere of the Earth, through which stellar light passes, and the atmospheres of stars which produce the spectral lines observed.
Both of these influence the spectra of the stellar light observed.
In this work synthetic models of both the Earth's atmosphere and stellar atmospheres are used to correct and analyse the observed spectra.
Details of each are included below.
