\section{Application to {CARMENES} spectra}

One of the main reasons for focusing on extending the work of~\citet{figueira_radial_2016} was to analyse the differences in {RV} precision of synthetic spectra and observed \nir{}.
This is important for the community to understand the accuracy of synthetic spectra.
\citet{artigau_optical_2018} recently found band-specific discrepancies in the theoretical precision between real and synthetic \nir{} spectra of Barnard's Star.
In 2018 {CARMENES} openly released a spectral library containing one spectrum for each target in their 324 M-dwarf {RV} survey in~\citet{reiners_carmenes_2018}.
With this they provide details on the empirical \(\delta V_{rms}\) measured during their {RV} processing with their {RV} analysis code, {SERVAL} \citep{zechmeister_spectrum_2018}, using all available spectra of each target.
Spectra from this library has been used to compare the theoretical precision of observed {CARMENES} spectra to synthetic models, and is still in the preliminary stages, with the progress so far demonstrated here.

\subsection{Target selection}
\label{subsec:carmense_targets}
To analyse the precision in different spectral types, a few specific M-dwarfs were selected.
These were selected from the 324 spectra of the {CARMENES} M-dwarf library from \citet{reiners_carmenes_2018} available at \href{http://carmenes.cab.inta-csic.es/gto/}{http://carmenes.cab.inta-csic.es/gto/}, along with the achieved \snr{} in the visible and \nir{} spectra.

The spectral library data was downloaded, divided into spectral type and ordered by the stated \nir{} {SNR}, to select targets at the high \snr{} end.
To cover the M-dwarf range, targets were selected near each of the spectral types M0, M3, M6 and M9.
For each spectral type (within $\pm0.5$) two stars are selected that have high {SNR} values. This will give eight spectra over the M-dwarf range to analysis.
One of the two selected targets for the M3 type is Barnard's star which has been analysed extensively in~\citet{artigau_optical_2018}, in particular with CRIRES spectra for the \nir{} domain, allowing for direct comparisons between the two works.
The other criteria used for selection was to select targets with a varied range of \Logg{} and \feh{} values if possible.

The selected targets from the {CARMENES} library are provided in \cref{tab:carmenes_selection_updated}.
The spectral parameters (\Teff{}, \Logg{}, \feh{}) for these targets are from \citet{passegger_carmenes_2018, rajpurohit_exploring_2018} who performed spectral fits of the {CARMENES} spectra with the {PHOENIX-ACES} and {BT-Settl} models respectively.
The uncertainties in the \citet{rajpurohit_exploring_2018} parameters are \(\sigma_{\teff{}}\)=100\K{}, \(\sigma_{\logg{}}\)=0.3, and \(\sigma_{\feh{}}\)=0.3 while the uncertainties on the 
\citet{passegger_carmenes_2018} values are \(\sigma_{\teff{}}\)=51\K{}, \(\sigma_{\logg{}}\)=0.07, and \(\sigma_{\feh{}}\)=0.16.
There are gaps in the \citet{passegger_carmenes_2018} values for stars that have the lower \snr{} levels as they are more difficult to analyse/fit.
Neither one has parameters for Luyten's Star, for which the parameters given are from {SIMBAD}.

\subsubsection{Spectral preparation and Telluric correction}
\label{subsec:prepatation_on_carmenes}
The spectra in the  {CARMENES} library have not been corrected for telluic lines.
To properly assess the theoretical {RV} precision attainable in the {CARMENES} spectra they need to be corrected for telluic lines.
Telluric correction is performed with the {Molecfit} software~\citep{smette_molecfit_2015} in collaboration with Sol\'ene Ulmer-moll, who has {Molecfit} experience~\citep{ulmer-moll_telluric_2018}.

The separate spectral orders first need to be combined into a single spectrum.
At this stage, where spectral orders overlap only the flux from one order is kept for simplicity.
The overlapping regions could be combined by taking the mean because the overlapping orders are well aligned in wavelength, but this was not performed at this exploratory stage.

The telluric correction is performed by dividing the {CARMENES} spectrum by a telluric transmission spectrum fitted with {Molecfit}.
The fitting with {Molecfit} has been attempted two different ways.
The first correction performs the fitting on the full \nir{} spectrum, while the second splits the spectrum into three parts and fits them separately.
This was done because it was noticed that the spectral line shape changes significantly from 0.9\um{} to 1.7\um{}.

Different molecules are fitted in the three separate parts.
In the first part (0.9--1.1\um{}) \ce{H2O} is fitted, in the second (1.1--1.5\um{}) \ce{O2} is fitted while \ce{CO2} and \ce{CH4} are fitted in the third section (1.5--1.71\um{}).
After this all molecule abundances are fixed and the final fit is performed on each of the three parts.

In the end, splitting the spectrum into three does not seem to improve the telluric correction considerably.
The telluric spectrum fitted from both attempts is shown in the top panel of \cref{fig:compare_telluric_corrections}.
The difference between the two telluric spectra changes is shown in the bottom panel.

It is unknown whether the full telluric correction of the {CARMENES} \nir{} spectrum has been performed before.
There has been one publication known which uses {Molecfit} to correct a {CARMENES} spectrum, but only in a very narrow spectral range (1.082--1.084\um{})~\citep{allart_spectrally_2018}.
As such there is not yet a definitive guide to achieve the best telluric correction of {CARMENES} spectra with {Molecfit}.

In this work only one spectrum has been telluric corrected to compare the difference between the two {Molecfit} corrections and their improvement over complete telluric masking on spectral quality and {RV} precision.
This was to see if it is worth investing time to improve the telluric correction step.

After telluric correction the spectrum was corrected for bad pixels by linear interpolation across them.
Some examples of bad pixels can be seen in a narrow wavelength range in \cref{fig:carmenes_spike_removal}.
The lines with orange circles and green crosses are the original and telluric corrected spectra, respectively.
They both show individual bad pixel spikes throughout the spectrum.
The black line is the spectrum corrected from the bad pixels (labelled `fixed') for the bad pixels. 
The blue line is a ``quality flag'' output (0 or 1) from {Molecfit}, indicating where the spectrum has a flux below or equal to zero.
It correctly identifies one of the bad pixels but not the others that have a flux above zero.
Within the \emph{Y}- \emph{J}-, and \emph{H}-bands there are around 213/66069\(\sim\)0.3\% bad pixels identified with an automated algorithm, based on a maximum derivative threshold (the bad pixels have very high derivatives).

The removal of bad pixels, which introduce pixels with very high derivatives (and pixel weight, $W(i)$), is essential for an accurate computation of the spectral quality and RV precision.
The sharp lines with high derivatives would artificially increases the calculated spectral quality, \(Q\), masquerading as very deep and narrow spectral lines.

\subsection{Impact of telluric correction}
\label{Impact_telluric_correction}
Here the impact of the telluric correction on the spectral quality of the CARMENES spectrum is assessed.
This was done by calculating, Q, with the original telluric lines deeper than 2\% masked out, and with the telluric correction performed.
This was done for both fitting methods attempted with Molecfit and displayed in \cref{fig:band_qualityfromapplyingtelluriccorrection}.
The top panel shows the telluric corrected spectrum (orange) along with the telluric mask that was applied (blue).
The bottom panel shows the spectral quality for the three spectral bands \emph{Y}, \emph{J}, and \emph{H}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/information-content/Carmenes/Band_quality_from_applying_telluric_correction}
    \caption[Barnard's star spectral quality.]{Measured spectral quality, Q, in the three \nir{} bands of Barnard's star to assess the gain from telluric correction. 
        Top: The telluric corrected CARMENES spectrum (orange) along with the binary mask for telluric lines >2\% depth (blue). 
        Bottom: The spectral quality in the three spectral bands, for different telluric treatment. `single' indicates the Molecfit results from the single fit to the spectrum, while 'triple' indicates the fit to the three wavelength bands.
        `masked' indicates that telluric masking of the lines deeper than 2\% was performed and while `corrected' is just the telluric corrected spectrum.}
    \label{fig:band_qualityfromapplyingtelluriccorrection}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:band_qualityfromapplyingtelluriccorrection} shows that there is a benefit (gain in quality) from telluric correction in the \emph{J} and \emph{H}-bands, where there are numerous telluric lines.
However, in the \emph{Y}-band where there is little telluric masking performed there is only a slight gain.
Performing telluric correction of the CARMENES spectra over telluric masking causes a gain the the spectral quality by 1\%, 30\%, 12\% in the \emph{Y}-band, \emph{J}, and \emph{H}-bands respectively.
As the spectral quality is related to the RV precision, this will lead to a 10-30\% improvement in the RV precision in the \emph{J}- and \emph{H}-bands
This indicated that it is worth performing telluric correction on the other seven {CARMENES} targets selected.
This also shows that the extra effort from three separate telluric fittings does not lead to a significant gain in quality.


\subsection{Barnard's star}
\label{sec:carmenes_barnards_star}
The {CARMENES} spectrum of Barnard's Star is shown in the top panel of \cref{fig:carmenes_correction}....
with the telluric correction current implementation used is the one that was split into of three chunks.

    \label{fig:carmenes_correction}
\end{figure}

Since a proper comparison between {RV} the results obtained two methods only one {CARMENES} spectrum has been corrected,Barnard's Star.
This work in telluric correcting the eight spectra chosen has been hampered by the difficulty faced in properly correcting the {CARMENES} spectra from telluric lines.
There have been issues achieving a reliable telluric correction with the {Molecfit} software on the {CARMENES} spectra (\emph{priv.\ comm.} Ulmer-mol (2018)).
At this stage only one spectrum has been corrected, Barnard's Star, to investigate if the {Molecfit} telluric correction is sufficient, and enhances the {RV} precision results.

- Barnard's star (Artigau 2018 comparison)

Figure \citep{} shows the uncorrected {CARMENES} spectrum (xxx) along with the current telluric model (black) the bottom panel shows the corrected {CARMENES} spectrum after division.
The main \nir{} \ce{H2O} bands are also excluded outside the lines...


This work is work in progress.
{I can calculate the {RV} precision from models though.}




This work added an extra feature to \eniric{} in the ability to calculated spectra on a shorter wavelength scale such as 2\% widths as done in \citep{artigau_optical_2018}.
