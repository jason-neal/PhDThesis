\section{Application to {CARMENES} spectra}


\subsection{Target selection}
This work in telluric correcting all spectra chosen has been hampered by the difficulty faced in correcting the CARMENES spectra from telluric lines.
There have been issues achieving a reliable telluric correction with the Molecfit software on the {CARMENES} spectra (private-communication Ulmer-mol (2018)).
At this stage only one spectrum has been corrected to compare the difference between Molecfit correction and complete telluric masking to see if it is worth investing time in improving the correction.

\subsection{Preparation of CARMENES spectra}
- preparation of observed spectra

Preparation of {CARMENES} spectra.

\subsection{Barnard's star}
- Barnard's star (Artigau 2018 comparison)


This work is work in progress.
So far only 1 of 8 planned {CARMENES} spectra have been telluric corrected to calculate the {RV} precision.

{I can calculate the {RV} precision from models though.}




\subsection{Comparing models to {CARMENES}.}
Already somewhat done in Reiners.
(use all spectra).
They measured the precision obtained in the spectra.

Band by band like~\citet{figueira_radial_2016}?
Certain\% steps like Bouchy or Artigau


Can do Barnard's star in {CARMENES}.
\todo{finish this} compared to models in Artigau.
