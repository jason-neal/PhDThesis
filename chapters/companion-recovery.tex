\chapter{Synthetic companion recovery}  % Main chapter title
\label{cha:model_comparison}

Following on from \cref{cha:direct_recovery}, in which the differential subtraction technique was unsuccessful due to the insufficient separation of the observations, a second method is attempted to detect the presence of the faint {BD} companions in the blended spectrum.
In this chapter a \textchisquared{} fitting approach is used to fit the observed spectra with a binary model comprised of two synthetic spectral components.
An overview of the method is presented followed by the preparation of the models.
A simulation with a larger M-dwarf companion to a G2V star is presented first, followed by a simulation and observations of {HD~211847}.
Injection-recovery simulations are performed to understand the limitations of this method and the results obtained.
A discussion of the results and a comparison to other similar techniques is given at the end.

\section{Summary}

\todo{Is another summary needed here? transition to next chapter}
After attempting two different methods to detect the companion BDs these observations were abandoned...
