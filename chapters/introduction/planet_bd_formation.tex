\section{Distribution of Exoplanets}

Exoplanetary detections have challenged the theoretical formation models with their variety and distribution of sizes, locations For instance, the discovery of the hot-Jupiter class (large mass planets on close in orbits) challenged the accepted planet formation theories at the time~\citep[.e.g][]{pollack_formation_1996, boss_giant_1997} in which our Solar System was thought to be typical with small rocky planets close to the Sun and large giant planets further away.


The precise characterization of more exoplanets with the detection of exoplanetary atmospheres will allow for the constraints of exoplanetary composition and formation mechanisms to be improved. For instance, the core accretion model has been able to reproduce the large number of Super-Earths, the correlation be star metallicity and planet frequency~\citep[e.g.][]{santos_spectroscopic_2004, fischer_planetmetallicity_2005}, and the presence of many Hot-Jupiter and Neptune in close-in orbits, with the help of migration mechanisms~\citep[e.g.][]{Triaud_exoplanets_2016}. Recent models also combine both planetary formation and evolution to describe the observed exoplanets~\citep[e.g.][]{mordasini_characterization_2012} and can reproduce general population properties in a statistically significant way~\citep{mordasini_characterization_2009}.

A proxy for the composition and structure of is the average density, computed from the mass and radius.   can be understood though A mass-radius diagram for as shown in \fref{fig:santerne2018} for Earth-like rocky planets. The tracks show lines of different theoretical compositions~\citep{brugger_constraints_2017}, while the circles indicate a number of detected small mass exoplanets, with K2-229\,b  being a Super_Earth with  Mercury-like density~\cite{santerne_earthsized_2018}.
The density can give an approximate composition but for a given mass there are an infinite combinations of metal/silicate/ice and gas that  can produce the same  radii~\citep[e.g.][]{seager_massradius_2007}.
Low mass planets tend to be rocky and tend to have small or no atmosphere. With rock being a approximately seen as in-compressible it is relatively insensitive to the incident flux. 
The radii of solid exoplanets are sensitive to gas content of the atmosphere as small increase in H/He can cause a large increase in radius~\citep{adams_ocean_2008}.

When the gas component becomes dominate  planets begin to have radii independent of their mass~\citep[e.g.][]{lopez_understanding_2014}. The atmospheres of gas giants are also susceptible to stellar irradiation, with close in Hot-Jupiters having inflated atmospheres and larger radii \citep[e.g][]{fortney 2009}. \todo{ Down to here}



For rocky planets models there are infinite combinations of Mass-radius. 
Models of the mass and radius for Earth like rocky planets for different compositions are given in \fref{fig:mass_radius_relation_composition}. A couple of exoplanets are shown along with the small Solar System planets. {Kepler-10\,b} and {CoRot-7\,b} seem to have similar composition to Earth/Venus of mostly mantle, while {Kepler-10\,c} is less dense with more water content. The composition varies from solid iron core (red) through a combination of silicates (rock forming minerals) out to 100\% water (blue).

For planets with atmospheres, especially gas giants on close in orbits, the mass radius relation is more complicated with inflation due to atmospheric heating.



There are two main formation mechanisms , core accretion and disk instability.
The presence of all the hot Jupiter is due to Migration in which the planets trade angular momentum with the planet forming disk to change position.

Several authors have found there are correlations with stellar metallicity, but less so with rocky planets.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in BD candidates triggered by exoplanetary searches.
While several works found similar properties on the two populations, like a similar density~\citep{hatzes_definition_2015}, others found intriguing differences.
One of the most recent is the different host metallicity of the Brown Dwarf and giant planet populations~\citep{santos_observational_2017, schlaufman_evidence_2018}, a very strong hint of different formation mechanisms.

\subsection{Brown Dwarfs}
\todo{This is mainly from the paper still.}
Brown dwarfs (BDs) are sub-stellar objects unable to achieve hydrogen fusion, with masses around \(13-80~\textrm{M}_{jup} \)~\citep{chabrier_theory_2000}, bridging the gap between low-mass stars and giant planets.
Without sustained fusion, brown-dwarfs cool down over time with an age-dependent cooling rate.
Therefore, there is an inherent degeneracy between the mass, age and luminosity of a given BD~\citep{burrows_nongray_1997}.
This degeneracy may be resolved by the observation of several parameters, for instance when a BD is in a binary system with a main sequence host star, using both the host stars age and the masses derived from the dynamical motion.

A paucity of BD companions exists in short period orbits around Sun-like stars (\(\lesssim5 \)\AU), compared to stellar or planetary companions, termed the \emph{brown dwarf desert}~\citep{halbwachs_exploring_2000, zucker_analysis_2001, sahlmann_search_2011}.
As the number of known BDs orbiting solar type stars is low, the characterization of benchmark BDs in the brown dwarf desert~\citep[e.g.][]{crepp_trends_2016} is beneficial in understanding this sub-stellar population and to help constrain formation and evolution theories~\citep{whitworth_formation_2007}.
The BD desert also provides a greater challenge as it reduces the amount of good BD candidates to study.

BDs in binary systems, unlike free-floating BDs, allow for the determination of their masses, when complemented with radial velocity ({RV}) and astrometry measurements.
The {RV} technique provides the mass lower-limit (\mtwosini{}) of binary and planetary companions, while complementary astrometry measurements can often provide mass upper-limits~\citep[e.g.][]{sahlmann_search_2011}.
Measuring or tightening the constraints of BD masses improves the understanding of mass dependence on BD formation processes.
For instance, there is growing evidence that the larger giant planets and BD companions do not follow the well known metallicity-giant planet correlation seen in main-sequence stars with planets~\citep[e.g.][]{santos_spectroscopic_2004,santos_observational_2017, maldonado_searching_2017}.
Photometry along with stellar evolution models~\citep[e.g.][]{baraffe_evolutionary_2003,allard_btsettl_2013} can also be used to estimate the mass of BD companions~\citep[e.g.][]{moutou_eccentricity_2017} if there is sufficient orbital separation, and a precise determination of the age~\citep{soderblom_ages_2010}.
