\subsection{Exoplanets to low mass stars}

Exoplanetary detections have challenged the theoretical formation models with their variety and distribution of sizes, locations For instance, the discovery of the hot-Jupiter class (large mass planets on close in orbits) challenged the accepted planet formation theories at the time~\citep[.e.g][]{pollack_formation_1996} in which our Solar System was thought to be typical with small rocky planets close to the Sun and large giant planets further away.

The characterization of exoplanets with the detection of exoplanetary atmospheres allows for the constraints of exoplanetary composition and formation mechanisms.

For rocky planets models there are infinite combinations of Mass-radius. Models of the mass and radius for Earth like rocky planets for different compositions are given in \fref{fig:mass_radius_relation_composition} with some Solar System planets and two exoplanets shown. The composition varies from solid iron core (red)) through a combination of silicates \textbf{(rocks)} out to 100\% water (blue).


For planets with atmospheres, especially gas giants on close in orbits, the mass radius relation is more complicated with inflation due to atmospheric heating. 



There are two main formation mechanisms , core accretion and disk instability. The presence of all the hot Jupiter is due to Migration in which the planets trade angular momentum with the planet forming disk to change position.

Several authors have found there are correlations with stellar metallicity, but less so with rocky planets.

did they form from the molecular cloud when the star was forming or from the remnants of the disk after the star formed like exoplanets....?
