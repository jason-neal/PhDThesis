\section{Exoplanet detection methods}
\label{sec:detection_methods}
There are several detection methods used to build up the picture of the current understanding of exoplanet candidates.
The different detection methods are often complementary, in that they are sensitive to different parameter spaces and are able to contribute different exoplanet properties, or detect different classes of exoplanet.
The simplest example is that planetary mass and radius are obtained from the radial velocity and transit methods separately.
Also the transit and radial velocity methods are both sensitive to large planets close to the star however, the direct imaging technique cannot see planets too close to the star, as the planets image is contaminated by the stellar image and speckles.

The exoplanet detection rates for different methods since 1995 are shown in \cref{fig:detection_year_method}.
The detection rates among different methods are not uniform, with the transit method having the majority of detections due to the use of the Kepler space telescope~\citep{borucki_finding_2008}.
The radial velocity method has a fairly consistent detection rate, while direct imaging and other methods have only made a small contribution to the total number of detections so far.
Details about the various main detection methods are provided in the following sections.

\subsection{Radial Velocimetry}
\label{subsec:radial_velocimetry}
This technique measures the radial velocity\footnote{Velocity projected along line of sight.} (RV) of the star by analysing the relative Doppler shift of its spectral lines due to the gravitational interaction with a companion.
As the star and companion orbit around their common centre of mass (barycentre) the spectrum of the star periodically oscillates, with the orbital period of the planet, due to the change in relative motion to the observer as depicted in \cref{fig:rvdiagram-mayor} (left).

\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:rvdiagram-mayor}
\end{figure}

The radial velocity variation, directed along the line of sight, is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rv_equation_intro}
{RV} = \gamma + K [\cos{(\nu(t, P, T_0, e) + \omega)} + e\cos{(\omega)}]
\end{equation}
where \(\gamma\) is constant barycentre velocity of the system relative to the Sun\footnote{Earth's barycentre motion is well known and removed.}, \(K\) is the velocity semi-amplitude, \(e\) the eccentricity, and \(\omega\) is the argument of periastron.
The true anomaly \(\nu\), is a function of time \(t\), orbital period \(P\), and the time of periastron passage \(T_0\), and eccentricity.

The velocity amplitude $K$ of a star of mass $\Mstar$ due to a companion with mass $\Mp$ with orbital period $P$, eccentricity $e$, and inclination\footnote{Relative to a plane that is tangential to the celestial sphere, $i=90$ is edge on.} $i$ is~\citep[e.g.][]{cumming_lick_1999}:
\begin{equation}
    K = {\left(\frac{2\pi G}{P}\right)}^{1/3} \frac{\Mp{} \sin{i}}{{(\Mp{} + \Mstar)}^{2/3}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{e}^{2}}}, \label{eqn:k_amplitude}
\end{equation}
where G is the gravitational constant.

The key exoplanet property determined by the amplitude {RV} technique is the companion mass, relative to the orbital inclination \Mpsini.
As the companion mass is in the numerator of \cref{eqn:k_amplitude} the {RV} technique is more sensitive to larger mass planets.
Also since $K \propto P^{-1/3}$ the amplitude is greater for short period close in orbits\footnote{From Kepler's Law ${P}^{2}\propto {a}^{3}$}.

    \label{fig:exoplaneteuyearmass}
\end{figure}

The {RV} method kick-started the exoplanet discipline by detecting the first exoplanet around a solar-type star {51 Pegasi}~\citep{mayor_jupitermass_1995}.
The {RV} curve for {51 Pegasi} is shown on the right side of \cref{fig:rvdiagram-mayor}.
The first discoveries were surprising as Jupiter mass planets in short period orbits\footnote{\Mpsini=0.47\,\Mjup{} orbiting at 0.05\AU{} for {51 Pegasi}} were unlike anything in our Solar System and not predicted by standard plant formation theories.
Several exoplanet discoveries followed in quick succession~\citep[e.g.][]{butler_planet_1996, marcy_planetary_1996} with many confirming the existence of the type of planets now referred to as ``hot-Jupiters''~\citep{butler_three_1997, charbonneau_detection_2000}.

The radial velocity amplitudes of the first exoplanets detected were around 60\mps{} while
the radial velocity signal of the Earth in a one year orbit around a solar-type star however is 8.9\cmps{}~\citep[e.g.][]{figueira_radial_2010}.
Dedicated spectrographs, such as HARPS~\citep{mayor_setting_2003} along with improved reduction techniques~\citep{lovis_new_2007} pushed this mass detection limit down to the \mps{} level.
ESPRESSO~\citep{pepe_espresso_2014, megevand_espresso_2014} is the next generation high precision optical spectrograph aiming to push the detection limits to 10\cmps, to detect an Earth twin.
The gradual decrease in measured mass of exoplanets over time is shown in \cref{fig:exoplaneteuyearmass}.
The different symbols indicate the detection method, not necessarily the method used to measure the exoplanet mass.

Most {RV} detection has been performed using optical spectrographs.
However, as the amplitude of {RV} signal is inversely proportional to the mass of the star (RV $\propto \Mstar^{-2/3}$), there are dedicated surveys focusing on smaller mass M-dwarf stars~\citep[e.g.][]{reiners_carmenes_2018}.
M-dwarfs are inherently cooler and thus emit a majority of their stellar output in the near-infrared.
New dedicated high-resolution \nir{} spectrographs have and are being designed and implemented to meet this demand e.g.\ {CARMENES}, {NIRPS}, {SPIRou}, {CRIRES+}.


\subsection{Transit methods}
\label{subsec:transit}
The transit method detects the presence of an exoplanet by observing the periodic dimming of the star due to the passage of the exoplanet between the star and observer, partially blocking the star.
Geometry requires the orbit of the exoplanet to be aligned edge-on to the line of sight (low inclinations) for a transit to occur.
The geometric probability, $P$, that a exoplanet transits is estimated by
\begin{equation}
P \approx \frac{\Rstar}{a (1-{e}^{2})},
\end{equation}
where \(e\) is the eccentricity of the orbit, $\Rstar$ is the star radii and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit (star-planet distance)~\citep[e.g.][]{barnes_effects_2007}.
The probability of transit increases with the size of the star but decreases with distance to the star.

The drop in stellar brightness during the transit allows the measurement of the planet/star radius ratio:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta L}{L}\sim{\left(\frac{\Rp}{\Rstar}\right)}^{2}
\end{equation}
where \(L\) is the luminosity of the star, \(\Delta L\) is the maximum luminosity variation (transit depth), and \(\Rstar\) and \(\Rp\) are the radius of the star and planet respectively.

The transit method complements {RV} measurements as the inclination, $i$, of the orbit can be determined from the transit.
This removes the {$\sin{i}$} ambiguity found in the \Mpsini{} of {RV} detections so the true mass, $\Mp$, of the exoplanet can be revealed.
The true mass along with the planet's radius provides a value for the exoplanets average density\footnote{$\rho \equiv \frac{\textrm{Mass}}{\textrm{Volume}} = \frac{3}{4\pi}\frac{\Mp}{\Rp^{3}}$}, hinting at the possible composition.

There are several other astrophysical phenomena which can mimic transiting exoplanet signals, created by configurations of two or more stars which may not involve an exoplanet.
For example a transiting low-mass or white-dwarf star, grazing binary stars, or a transit in a multi-star system~\citep[see e.g.][]{cameron_extrasolar_2012, santerne_contribution_2013}.
Follow-up {RV} observations~\citep[e.g.][]{santerne_radial_2011} are usually required to confirm the planets existence.
Statistical validation techniques are also possible, such as the PASTIS software~\citep{diaz_pastis_2014}, when follow-up can not be performed.
These techniques assess the likelihood of the planet being a true planet against the different false positive scenarios, validating or confirming the planet if the likelihood is high enough.

The transit method has the highest false positive rate among the detection methods presented here.
With {RV} follow-up,~\citet{santerne_sophie_2012} found a false positive rate as high as 35\% for short period giant planets, while~\citet{santerne_sophie_2016} found a 54.6\% false positive rate of 129 giant planets with periods less than 400 days.
These sub-sample false positive rates are however higher than the global false positive rate of 9.4\%~\citep{fressin_false_2013}/11.3\%~\citep{santerne_contribution_2013} found for Kepler.
Some of the currently known exoplanet systems with the smallest radii and lightest mass have been detected through transit and later confirmed with high-precision {RV} follow-up~\citep[e.g.][]{queloz_corot7_2009, pepe_earthsized_2013, lopez-morales_kepler21b_2016, ment_second_2018}.

The identification of unresolved multiple stars, such as a binary or an unrelated background star, can be achieved through high-resolution spectroscopy in which the spectral lines of individual stars can be separated~\citep{kolbl_detection_2015}.
This is important to measure the correct radii of exoplanets as the extra light contribution from an unresolved secondary star will reduce the transit depth, mimicking a smaller transiting planet.

The transit of a single planet can not directly determine the planetary mass.
However, in multiple planet systems, the masses and sometimes the presence of other planets in the system can be determined from perturbations in the transit time and duration~\citep[e.g.][]{holman_use_2005, holman_kepler9_2010}.
A large number of systems have been detected that show transit timing variations (TTV) and transit duration variations (TDV)~\citep[e.g.][]{holczer_transit_2016} due to the gravitational interaction between planets.
The statistical validity of multi-transiting planets is more straightforward than single planets as the probability of having multiple false positives, being the product of the individual probabilities, is lower than having multiple planets in the system~\citep{lissauer_almost_2012}, making multiple planet systems easier to validate.

The presence of star spots on the surface of a star can be observed during transit.
A star spot is a dark region on the stellar surface due to magnetic fields, which decreases the luminosity slightly.
Examples of spots can be seen in the middle of the Sun from an image of the 2012 transit of Venus in \cref{fig:transit_venus_transit_alignment} (left).
It shows several dark sunspots alongside Venus, although Venus did not cross them.
Unlike for other stars, sunspots are spatially resolved.
If an exoplanet passes in front of a spot, the luminosity decrease from the spot is temporarily hidden and a small bump occurs in the transit shape.
The presence of spots in successive transits (see \cref{fig:transit_venus_transit_alignment} (right)) can indicate the alignment of the stellar rotation to the planet orbital plane~\citep{sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2013}.
In this simulation an orbit aligned with the stellar rotation and the transit crosses the spot in four successive orbits.
In a misaligned case a spot would only be observed in one transit.

The vast majority of transit detections have come from Kepler~\citep{borucki_characteristics_2011}, which focused on a small patch of sky (0.25\%) for four years continuously.
Kepler's impressive sensitivity compared to previous surveys, allowed it to detect planets down to around 2\Rearth.
However, {CoRoT}~\citep{barge_transiting_2008} and ground-based surveys, such as WASP~\citep{pollacco_wasp_2006}, OGLE~\citep{udalski_optical_2002}, TreS~\citep{alonso_tres1_2004} have also had successful transit detections.

Following in Kepler's footsteps the next generation transit hunter {TESS}~\citep{ricker_transiting_2015} has already announced discoveries of new transiting planets only months after launch~\citep{vanderspek_tess_2018, gandolfi_tess_2018, huang_tess_2018}.
It will eventually cover more than 90\% of the sky with an impressive planetary yield expected of $\sim10\,000$ exoplanets, with around 3500 the size of Neptune or smaller~\citep{barclay_revised_2018, huang_expected_2018}.
However, the observation coverage is not uniform, with the majority of the ecliptic plane receiving only one month of observations, limiting the detection sensitivity to short period transiting planets.
On the other hand, the ecliptic poles will receive almost one year continuous observation.

{PLATO} \citep{rauer_the_2014} is another transit survey mission planned for launch in 2026.
In contrast to Kepler it will focus on brighter nearby, stars, with the goal to detect and accurately determine the planetary parameters of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone.

A smaller transiting mission, {CHEOPS} \citep{broeg_cheops_2013}, is also scheduled for launch at the end of 2019.
Unlike the transiting surveys mentioned above, {CHEOPS} will perform dedicated transit follow-up of bright stars with known planets, such as those found with {RV} surveys.
It will providing high precision transit photometry, if the geometry allows, to obtain precise planetary radii.


\subsection{Direct Imaging}
\label{subsec:direct_detection}
The direct imaging technique involves directly imaging an exoplanet in orbit around a star.
The first planets directly imaged were {2MASSWJ~1207334--393254~b} using adaptive optics with NACO on the VLT~\citep{chauvin_giant_2004}, three planets around HR\,8799 using angular differential imaging on the Keck and Gemini telescopes~\citep{marois_direct_2008}, and {Fomalhaut~b} using chronography on the HST~\citep{kalas_optical_2008}.
As an example, the direct image of {HR\,8799} is shown in \cref{fig:directimaging}, where a fourth planet was revealed~\citep{marois_images_2010}.

Direct imaging requires resolving the angular separation between the star and planet and is best suited to detect giant planets in wide orbits (>10\AU{}) around nearby stars.
This is shown by the clustering of direct image detections shown in \cref{fig:exoplaneteuyearmass}.
Extremely young giants observed in the infrared are favoured as they have higher thermal emissions (while they are still cooling) and larger surface area resulting in a higher contrast ratio to the host.

\end{figure}

High-contrast adaptive optics instruments, such as SPHERE@VLT~\citep{beuzit_sphere_2008} and GPI~\citep{macintosh_gemini_2008}, are being used with several different techniques to observe targets closer to the star and with smaller contrasts, usually involving blocking or cancelling out the light from the star while retaining the signal of the planet~\citep[e.g.][]{marois_direct_2005, mawet_annular_2005, schmid_zimpol_2005, sirbu_prospects_2017, sirbu_techniques_2017, wang_observing_2017}.
Ground based direct imaging requires adaptive optics to reduce the turbulence induced by the atmosphere, increasing the angular resolution down to the telescope diffraction limit.

On top of hardware based solution to the stellar contamination, cleaver observing strategies and cancelling algorithms.
Angular differential imaging (ADI) \citep[eg.][]{marois_direct_2005} is one such technique.
ADI, disables the field de-rotator component in the telescope so that the viewing field rotates relative to the plane of the detector during the night.
Several images taken at different angles are rotated to a reference position and stacked.
The stacking of images from different angles cancels out the pseudo-static speckle caused by the telescope and optics while increasing the contrast of any faint object in the stars vicinity, i.e. a planetary companion.

The direct imaging technique is also used to observe circumstellar and protoplanetary disks, and has even captured images of planets during formation~\citep[e.g.][]{sallum_accreting_2015}.
Combining direct images from different photometric bands can allow for the creation of low-resolution exoplanet spectra~\citep[e.g.][]{kuzuhara_direct_2013, zurlo_new_2015}.


\subsection{Astrometry}

\label{subsec:astrometry}
Astrometry measures the precise position of the stars on the plane of the sky.
The motion of a star with an exoplanet about its centre of mass can be observed in the periodic oscillating of position from its proper motion in the sky.

For a circular orbit the angle of the semi-major axis of the apparent orbital ellipse, the amplitude of the astrometric signature ($\theta$), is given by
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{M_{p}}{M_{star} + M_{p}} \frac{a}{d}
\end{equation}
where, $\Mp$ and $\Mstar$ are the planet and stellar mass, $a$ is the semi-major axis (in \AU) and $d$ is the distance from the observer to the system (in parsec)~\citep{perryman_exoplanet_2011}.

This shows that the astrometric signal is proportional to the companion/star mass ratio and to the orbital radius, $a$.
The amplitude also decreases inversely with distance, as the angles become smaller.
This is unlike the {RV} and transit methods for which the amplitude is not affected by distance.
Astrometry is complementary to the {RV} method as it measures the orbital motion perpendicularly to the line of sight, allowing the three-dimensional orbit to be determined.

A modelled astrometric signal is shown in \cref{fig:astrometry_perryman}, for a star at a distance of 50\pc, with a proper motion of 50\masperyr{}, and orbited by a planet of $\Mp = 15$\,\Mjup{}, $e = 0.2$, and $a = 0.6$\AU~\citep{perryman_extrasolar_2000}.
The straight dashed line shows the path of the system's barycentric motion viewed from the Solar System barycentre.
The dotted line shows the effect of parallax (the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun, with a period of 1 year).
The solid line shows the apparent motion of the star as a result of the planet, the additional perturbation being magnified by $\times 30$ for visibility.

Although astrometry has detected many binary stars~\citep[e.g.][]{gontcharov_new_2000} and found several brown-dwarf companions~\citep[e.g.][]{sahlmann_search_2011}, the exoplanet discovery's are few.
A 1.5\,\Mjup{} mass planet in a roughly 1000 day orbit around {HD\,176051} was reported by~\citet{muterspaugh_phases_2010}, and recently the astrometric perturbation of a known planet, {Beta Pictoris~b}, was performed utilizing measurements from {GAIA}~\citep{collaboration_gaia_2016a} and {HIPPARCOS}~\citep{esa_hipparcos_1997} to determine a mass of 11\,\Mjup~\citep{snellen_mass_2018}.

The predicted astrometric variations for an exoplanet are at the level of sub-milliarcseconds and therefore are not achievable from the ground due to atmospheric turbulence.
The most precise astrometric measurements come from spacecraft.
These are currently being performed using GAIA with the recent release of astrometric parameters for 1332~million sources~\citep{collaboration_gaia_2018} and reaching a precision of 0.04\,mas for the brightest stars (<14 magnitude).
Simulations predict that more than 21\,000 large mass planets (1--15\,\Mjup) in long-period orbits should be discovered during the 5 year nominal GAIA mission~\citep{perryman_astrometric_2014}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Microlensing}
\label{subsec:microlensing}
Microlensing is an astronomical effect predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.
The mass of an object bends space-time which causes light to be visibly deflected around large mass objects.
As a star passes between Earth and a distant star it acts like a lens, bending and magnifying the light from the background star.
The gravitation of a planet orbiting the lens star (if it exists) creates a distortion in the lens, leading to small caustics, deviations in the microlensing light curve for a single lens event (star without a planet).

An example is shown in \cref{fig:microlensing_example} where a lensing magnification of up to $\times3$ is observed for {OGLE2005-BLG-390}~\citep{beaulieu_discovery_2006}.
On the falling edge of the lensing event (and inset top right) there is a bump due to the presence of a 5.5\,\Mjup{} companion.

The difficulties of microlensing is that they require the chance alignment between Earth, a nearby lens star, and a distance source star, which is unrepeatable.
Some caustics are often difficult to fit and yield degenerate results, making characterization of the planet difficult.
Follow-up measurements of a handful of microlensing events have been performed~\citep[e.g.][]{kubas_frozen_2012, batista_confirmation_2015, santerne_spectroscopic_2016} to break degeneracies.
However, follow-up can be difficult as microlensing is sensitive to distant host stars, which are outside the ability of current spectrographs.
It is also sensitive to planets with a wider orbital separation compared to transits and {RV}.
Currently there are 87 planets in 82 systems detected by microlensing, as listed in the \href{https:\\www.exoplanet.eu}{exoplanet.eu} database.

The microlensing technique has been efficient in detecting Neptune analogue planets, distant planets similar in size to Neptune.
Showing that cold Neptune planets are likely most common pe of planet outside of the snow line \citep{suzuki_exoplanet_2016}, the distance from the star at which point it is cold enough for volatile compounds (e.g.\ \ce{H20}, \ce{NH3}, \ce{CO2}) to condense into solid ice grains.

Microlensing events are detected and monitored using dedicated global telescope networks such as {OGLE}, {MOA}, {microFUN} and {PLANET}.
They focus their viewing towards the galactic bulge where there are more stars and a higher chance for microlensing events to occur.

The precise stellar proper motions from the GAIA mission are being used to predict possible future alignments that could produce microlensing events~\citep{kluter_prediction_2018}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Pulsar timing}
\label{subsec:pulsar_timing}
Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars or white dwarfs formed after the death of a giant star, that radiate an intense electromagnetic beam.
The timing variations of the millisecond pulsar\footnote{Rotating at 9\,650 revolutions per minute} {PSR1257+12} led to the first extrasolar planet detection~\citep{wolszczan_planetary_1992}.
There are two models of planet formation around pulsars: either they formed before the supernova explosion and survived, or they formed after, from the remnants of the supernova~\citep{starovoit_existence_2017}.
There is still a rarity of less than 10 pulsars with known orbiting planets.

The rarity of these events is partially associated to the technique which requires very precise instrumentation on high cadence (< milliseconds) to precisely measure the electromagnetic radiation from the pulsar.
For example the first pulsar was detected with the Arecibo radio telescope.
With the primary dish fixed into the mountain, its pointing is limited and achieved by moving the receiver.
It has a limited number of stars that can be observed with a sufficient time coverage to detect planets around pulsars.
