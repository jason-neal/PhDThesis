\chapter{Information content in the \nir{}}
\label{cha:nir_content}

The work presented in this chapter focuses on calculating and analysing the information content of stellar spectra, specifically the radial velocity precision of M-dwarf spectra in the \nir{}.
This work is not directly related to detecting exoplanet atmospheres themselves but will aid in future exoplanet discoveries.
For instance, the fundamental radial velocity precision of {M-dwarf} spectra attainable at different wavelength regions calculated in~\citet{figueira_radial_2016} was used to influence some design choices of two \nir{} spectrographs, {SPIRou} and {NIRPS}.
Understanding the underlying precision of different spectral types can also allow {RV} surveys to adjust the focus the target selection, or optimize the exposure time of different spectral types.
This can help in detecting the presence of ``habitable Earth-like'' planets around {M-dwarfs} which have become a prime target with the recent \nir{} spectrographs.

The purpose of the work presented in this chapter is to extend the work of~\citet{figueira_radial_2016}, computing the theoretical {RV} precision of synthetic stellar spectra over a wider range of situations.
A investigation into the effect of \Logg{} and \feh{} on precision is performed and a preliminary comparison of {RV} precision of the recently observed \nir{} {M-dwarf} spectra from {CARMENES} library and their synthetic counterparts is given.
This is to test how the {RV} precision of synthetic models compares to reality.
Computations of the {RV} precision of synthetic spectral libraries are given, which were provided for exposure time calculators of {NIRPS} and {SPIRou}. 


\section{Overview}
\label{sec:precision_overview}
The pursuit of detecting exoplanets, especially ``habitable'' and ``Earth-like'' planets, requires state-of-the-art instrumentation with high precision.
Several new high-resolution \nir{} spectrographs are becoming available now and in the near future, not limited to {CARMENES}, {NIRPS}, {SPIRou} and {CRIRES+} (see \cref{subsec:new_generation}).
One science objective common to all four instruments is the detection of small mass planets around {M-dwarf} stars utilizing the radial velocity technique.
As the {RV} amplitude is \(\kone\propto {P}^{-{1/2}}{\mone}^{-2/3}\) (\cref{eqn:k_relation}), the induced {RV} wobble from a similarly sized exoplanet is larger around an M-dwarf star, making the {RV} signal from lower mass exoplanets easier to detect.
Also the cooler M-dwarfs have habitable zones closer to the star, at shorter orbital periods that again have a stronger {RV} amplitude.
Making it easier to detect small mass planets in the habitable zone of {M-Dwarfs}.

To calculate and predict the information content attainable from {M-dwarfs} in the \nir{}~\cite{figueira_radial_2016} utilized the {PHOENIX-ACES} library of synthetic spectra.
This helped to aid the direction of instrument design by identifying the wavelength regions with the best {RV} precision, but can also help in the planning of observations, by understanding how the precision changes with spectral type and observed {\snr{}}.
However, the synthetic spectra do not quite match reality and a comparison between theoretical and observed is needed.
\citet{artigau_optical_2018} recently compared optical (HARPS, {ESpaDOnS) and \nir{} (CRIRES) archival spectra of the M-dwarf, Barnard's Star, to synthetic spectra.
They found that state-of-the-art atmosphere models over-predict the {RV} content \emph{Y}- and \emph{J}-band {RV} by more than a factor of \(\sim\)2, while under-predicting the \emph{H}- and \emph{K}-band content by half.
A similar comparison will be made in this work to {CARMENES} spectra.

Recent results regarding the measured performance of the CARMENES survey~\citep{reiners_carmenes_2018,quirrenbach_carmenes_2018} find that the {RV} in the \nir{} is worse than the pre-survey predictions.
Precisions of 1--2\mps{} have been achieved in the optical but only 5--10\mps{} in the \nir{}.
However, comparing RV precision in different wavelength bands~\citet{quirrenbach_carmenes_2018} find a ``sweet spot'' around 0.7--0.8\um{} with deep \ce{TiO} bands providing rich {RV} information in mid-M dwarfs.

\section{Metallicity \Logg{} effects}
We explore the effect of metallicity and \Logg{} on the spectral quality of spectra in the {PHOENIX-ACES} library by extending the quality factor and precisions computation to \feh{} between -1--1 and \Logg{} of 4.0--5.5.
In \cref{fig:deviations} the variation of quality factor with broadening of R=100\,000 and $\vsini=1.0$\kmps{} across the {M-dwarf} spectral types and the \nir{} bands is shown.
We observed multiple different effects present.


The \emph{Z}-band has a large separation in spectral quality due to spectral type, this is because the continuum the \emph{Z}-band is severely eroded in the spectra of late M's as they cool.
Each spectral type also behaves very differently to a change in \feh{} and \Logg{}.
For {M0} and {M3} there is an increase with \feh{} below solar metallicity, above solar metallicity the slopes of the lines dramatically increase, especially for {M3}.
For {M6} and {M9} there is a step slope with \feh{} below solar metallicity, which flattens off at solar metallicity, and even decreases for the {M9} spectra above solar metallicity.
As \Logg{} increases in the \emph{Z}-band there is a decrease in quality.
There is a consistently large separation between early and late M's that.
The quality for {M6} is very shallow, while for {M9} the quality is nearly flat for \Logg{}=4.0 and 4.5 but then decreases sharply at higher \Logg{}.

\emph{Y}-band -\\

\emph{J}-band - \\

For the H and \emph{K}-band there is fairly consistent linear trend for all spectral types, with the quality factor increasing with an increase in \feh{} and decreasing with an increase in \Logg{}.
There is also only a relatively small variation in quality factor due to the spectral type.

\section{{SPIRou} and {NIRPS} {ETC}}\label{sec:spirou_nirps_etc}
Having this tool to calculate {RV} precisions efficiently lead to contributions to the Exposure Time Calculators (ETC) for both the {SPIRou} and {NIRPS} spectrographs.

In September 2017 \todo{we} were requested to provide precision calculations for the {SPIRou} ETC\footnote{\url{http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/SPIRou/SPIRou_etc.php}}.
These were the same table as~\citet{figueira_radial_2016} but with a each band referenced to 100~{\snr{}} in its own band.
The modification to use the centre of any band was made to fulfil this request.
Notes on the telluric correction issue affect on Condition~2.

In May 2018 \todo{we} were requested to provide precision calculations for the {NIRPS} {ETC}.\@ This extended the spectral range from {M0}, {M3}, {M6}, {M9} at 3900, 3500, 2800, 2600\K{} respectively, but to all temperatures between 2500 and 4000\K{} inclusively.
This provides a finer resolution coverage over the M spectral type, allowed by the {PHOENIX-ACES} library.
Instrumental resolutions of 75\,000 and 100\,000 were requested to match the {NIRPS} instrument.
The \Logg{} and metallicity, sampling rate remained at the~\citet{figueira_radial_2016} levels of 4.5, \textbf{0.0} and 3.0 respectively.\todo{}
Precisions were provided for \snr{} of 100 relative to the \emph{J}-, \emph{H}-bands as well as to each band individually.
Artigua 2018 (private communication 2018).\todo{Check how to cite priv communication properly}  suggested the truly relevant value is the \snr{} in \emph{H}-band for {NIRPS} radial velocities.

The results can be manually generated using ``eniric'' with the following incantation (after installation and configuration of {PHOENIX} library spectra.)
\textbf{A table of the precisions created for the {NIRPS} ETC are provided as an online table to \todo{our} publication} {Neal et al.
2018b (in prep.)}\footnote{Review at \href{https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/1053}{https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/1053}} \todo{Fix up when accepted}.


These values were both calculated and provided using the {FFD} gradient and with the incorrect masking order for Condition~\#2, splitting before calculating the pixel weights.
As \todo{we} demonstrated in \cref{sec:numerical_gradient,subsubsec:masking_order} these have a {RV} precision \(\sim\)2--7\% better than what would be computed with the current implementation.
