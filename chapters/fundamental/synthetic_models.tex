\section{Synthetic Stellar models}:

In the work we make extensive use of the {PHOENIX-ACES} models with some experimentation with the {BT-Settl} models.
A collection of several theoretical stellar spectral libraries can be found at Spanish Virtual Observatory \href{http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/newov/index.php}{Theoretical Spectra Web Server}.

Harder to work with.

Other models which have not been used here.
Kruz models a directory of different model can be found \ldots{}?

BT-Settl have less but are suitable for BDs.
We did not extend below the {PHOENIX-ACES} lower temperature of 2300\K{}
