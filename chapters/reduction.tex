\chapter{Spectroscopic reduction} % Main chapter title
\label{cha:reduction}

The work of this thesis relies on the use of \nir{} spectra obtained by the {CRIRES} instrument. Specifically 17 observations around 2.11-2.16\um{} which are detailed in \cref{tab:observations}.
This chapter contains an overview of the steps undertaken to extract astronomical spectra, focusing on the {CRIRES} instrument specifically.
A comparison between two different reduction pipelines for {CRIRES} is performed with the chosen pipeline used.
Details of the issues encountered with the reduction output are presented.
This chapter also includes the post reduction steps performed, specifically wavelength calibration and telluric correction.
The reduced spectra produced in this chapter will be analysed in \cref{cha:direct_recovery} and \cref{cha:model_comparison}.


\subsection{\nir{} reduction concepts}
\label{subsec:nirreduction}
In reducing \nir{} spectra, or any spectra in general a number of calibration steps that are performed to achieve the best possible e output such as removing signals arising from the detector. The main calibration steps required for \nir{} spectra are given below with examples from {CRIRES}. More information about the different effects with regards to CRIRES can be found in the CRIRES user manual and reduction cook.

\subsubsection{Dark Current}
\label{subsubsec:darkcurrent}
The dark current is a form of instrumental noise, in which the detector measures photons while not being illuminated.
It is the detection of thermal electrons moving inside the detector, creating spurious photon counts.
Calibration and removal of the dark current is performed by taking exposures in which the detector is not illuminated.
The detectors in the {CRIRES} instrument are cryogenically cooled to a temperature of \(\sim27\)\K{} (within 0.1\K{}) to significantly reduce the dark current, and to maintain consistency.
The electrical components of the {CRIRES} detectors create thermal energy while operational which impacts the dark current.
A strong ``glow'' is observed in the bottom corners of the {CRIRES} detector in \cref{fig:darkcurrent_colour} due to nearby amplifiers.
As per the {CRIRES} calibration plan, ``dark frames'' need to be taken for each exposure time used.
\Cref{fig:darkcurrent_colour} shows the master dark frame created from averaging three dark frames for exposure times of 3 seconds (for the flats) and 180 seconds (for the science), both on the same amplitude scale.
For the {CRIRES} detectors the dark current per pixel is around 0.2--0.4\,(\(e^{-}\)\si{\per\second}), while the glow at the two corners of the 180 second exposure shown here is \(\sim9000 / 180\approx50\)\,\(e^{-}\)\si{\per\second}.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Flat-field}
\label{subsubsec:flat-field}
No detector is truly perfect, with all pixels performing equally well.
To correct for pixel-to-pixel variations in photon sensitivity across the detector and for any distortions in the optical path, a flat-field correction is needed.
Exposures of a uniform\footnote{Ideally uniform intensity and spectral distribution} light source are taken, allowing the individual pixel-to-pixel sensitivity to be measured and corrected.
The flat-field frames are corrected for dark current by subtraction of the master dark frame with the appropriate exposure time.

The {CRIRES} detector suffers from non-linearities in sensitivity across the detector.
This can be seen in the flat-field image on the left of \cref{fig:masterflats_colour} where there is an intensity gradient from dark to light across the detector.
A set of coefficients for each pixel is provided by {ESO}\footnote{Available at \href{https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/crires/tools.html}{https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/crires/tools.html}} to apply the correction for the non-linearity of the detectors.
This also corrects for a slight difference in sensitivity between the pixels from the odd and even columns in the {CRIRES} detectors, commonly called the ``odd-even effect''.
The frame on the right of \cref{fig:masterflats_colour} has been corrected for the non-linearities.

The flat-field can also reveal defects in the detector e.g.\ dead pixels, dust and scratches; a large scratch is clearly visible in \cref{fig:masterflats_colour}.

\subsubsection{Nodding and Jitter}
\label{subsec:nod-jitter}
The technique of \emph{nodding} is used to remove sky emission, detector dark current, and glow.
First, an observation is divide into multiple separate exposures.
Between each exposure the telescope is moved to change the vertical position of the target in the slit.
The light from the star travels through a slightly different optical path and is recorded on a different part of the detector.
The frames from the two nod positions (A, B) are then subtracted (A - B) to remove the background measurement from each spectra.

A visual example of the nodding is shown in \cref{fig:nodimages}.
On the left are slices of 150 pixel columns from successive nod positions A and B as well as the difference A minus B.
On the right is a single pixel column from each image on the left.
The background signal at the level of 20--30 counts in the image is almost cancelled out by the opposite nod.
This efficiently removes the background signal/noise from the observed spectra target.

Observations of faint targets, that need long exposure times to achieve a sufficient \snr{}, are also broken up into multiple images so that the instrument glow from \cref{fig:darkcurrent_colour} does not saturate the detector.
A small random vertical offset is applied to each observation which ensures that all spectra at the same nod position do not consistently land on the same pixels each time.
This is known as the \emph{jitter} and allows for the correction of bad pixels and decreases the effect from any systematics of the detector.
As an example, the {CRIRES} observations analysed for the work performed in \cref{cha:direct_recovery,cha:model_comparison} were performed with an {ABBAABBA} nod cycle pattern (including jitter) with an exposure time of 180\,\si{\second} each, totalling 24 minutes when combined.

\subsection{\thar{} lamp calibration}
\label{subsec:th-ar}
As part of the {CRIRES} calibration procedure, spectra are taken of \thar{} lamps.
The \thar{} spectra are placed into the instrument using 6 optical fibres, creating six uniformly spaced spectra across the detector.
\cref{fig:caliblamps} contains the \thar{} spectra for all four detectors.
There are \(\sim50\) \thar{} lines that fall across the four detectors for the wavelength setting here, although most of them are faint.

The purpose of the \thar{} fibres is to perform cross-correlation against a \thar{} template to obtain a wavelength solution for each detector.
Optical defects (e.g.\ scratches on the detector) interfere with the performance of the correlation between \thar{} lines and the spectral template in {ESO} pipeline.
This can be resolved by first applying a pixel mask (although we did not attempt it).
At the top and bottom there are also two meteorological fibres that can not be used for wavelength calibration as they pass through a different optical pathway.
The brightest one at the bottom has strong features that seem to overwhelm or washout many columns in detector \#2--4 (vertical stripes).
This information is included here for completeness, as the \thar{} were not used in the chosen data reduction method, see \cref{subsec:wavecalib}.

\subsection{Extraction}
\label{subsec:extraction}
The process of extraction is, in brief, turning the two-dimensional image of the spectrum into a one-dimensional representation.
This is done by summing the photon counts along the spatial direction, for each column in the dispersion direction in a small window around the spectrum.
To do this one needs to identify the position of the spectrum across the detector, referred to as {order tracing}.
In our case there is only one spectral order present but in a cross-dispersed configuration there can and will be many orders.
A rectangular box, with a specified aperture width, is centred along the traced spectrum.

There are two types of extraction commonly used.
The \emph{rectangular} extraction performs a simple aperture sum in the spatial direction, counting all photon counts that fall within the aperture.
An \emph{optimal} extraction~\citep{horne_optimal_1986} also includes variance weighting to reduce the impact of the noise and deviant pixels on the spectral extraction.
A spatial profile is fitted to the spectra and the pixels weighted such that the those furthest away from the centre have less impact on the sum.
Optimal extraction can increase the effective exposure time by up to 1.69 times at \(3 \sigma\)~\citep{horne_optimal_1986}.
Both rectangular and optimal extraction methods are available from both the {ESO} {CRIRES} and {DRACS} pipeline, compared below.

\subsection{Reduction experience:}
\label{subsec:experience}
The experience gained in reducing {CRIRES} spectra enabled participation in collaboration with other science cases.
The {DRACS} pipeline was used to extract the spectra of two other targets.
A target and a very brief aim of each science case is given below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Barnard's Star\footnote{Programme {{ID}}: 085.D-0161(A)}: The carefully reduced \nir{} spectra of Barnard's Star was meant to extend the work of~\citet{andreasen_nearinfrared_2016} in deriving the spectroscopic parameters of cool M-stars in the \nir{}.
Unfortunately the work did not advance enough to analyse M-star's and a spectrum of {Arcturus} (K0) and a fully reduced spectrum of {10Leo} (K1) from the {CRIRES}-POP library~\cite{nicholls_crirespop_2017} were analysed instead in~{Andreasen et al. (in prep.)}.
\item \(\eta\) Tel\footnote{Programme {{ID}}: 083.C-0759(A)}: The spectra of a telluric standard star (HIP100090) and {HR\,7329-B} (\(\eta\) Tel-B) a rapidly rotating Brown Dwarf, were reduced to accurately determine the BD rotation rate by measuring the line broadening.
The results from this data will be published in an upcoming paper {Hagelberg et al. (in prep.)}.
\item The same spectra of {HR\,7329-B} were also used in~\citet{ulmer-moll_telluric_2018} to compare different telluric correction methods in the \nir{}.
An example from~\citet[][(B.3)]{ulmer-moll_telluric_2018} of the reduced target spectrum (black), the telluric model () and the telluric corrected spectrum (green) is provided in \cref{fig:ulmermol2018tellcorrcrires48}.
\end{itemize}

For these works only the spectral extraction outlined above was performed.
The post extraction and reduction steps detailed in the following sections were not.
