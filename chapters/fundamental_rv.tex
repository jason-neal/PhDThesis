\chapter{Fundamental Radial Velocity}
\label{cha:rv_concepts}

The radial velocity method, has been a consistent power-horse for the measurement of the orbital motion of binary stars and stars hosting exoplanets.
In this chapter some of the key properties of Keplerian orbits and the RV signal will be presented along with an introduction to the notion of RV precision.
