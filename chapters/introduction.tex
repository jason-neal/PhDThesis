\section{Towards the characterization of exoplanets}

The field of exoplanetary science is rapidly accelerating with large scientific and instrumental investments undertaken, with the ultimate goal of detecting and characterizing an Earth-like planet, with the potential for life (as we know it).
Since the very first exoplanet detection\footnote{around a Sun-like star}~\citep{mayor_jupitermass_1995} the number of confirmed\footnote{Validated by more than one detection method} exoplanets has grown to over 3790 with almost another 3000 candidates awaiting confirmation\footnote{\href{https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/}{exoplanets.nasa.govt} as of October 2018}.
However, simply detecting the presence of exoplanets is not nearly enough to satisfy our quest for knowledge.
There is an exorbitant amount to be gained through the full characterization of these known exoplanets: density, composition, internal structure, atmosphere properties, and surface temperature.

When an Earth-twin planet is suspected (there have been several false claims already \textbf{~\citep[e.g.][]{mullally_kepler_2018} \textbf{more}\todo{other dead earth-like planets} other earth like planets shown to not be earth like or redacted papers}) a full characterization is required to confirm it's habitability \textbf{(ref)}.
For instance, knowing only the mass and radius can provide an average density but not the composition or the internal structure~\textbf{ref cite {a paper about composition degeneracy}}.
The presence of an exoplanet's atmosphere will also influence the average density but can provide detectable clues on the planet's composition.
Several techniques being explored to detect and characterize exoplanet atmospheres~\citep[e.g.][]{snellen_orbital_2010, martins_reflected_2016, piskorz_evidence_2016} \textbf{a transmission spectroscopy paper} with several recent advancements.

In this chapter the common exoplanet and atmospheric detection methods will be introduced, followed by some exoplanet property distributions and the motivation for the work performed in this thesis.\\
