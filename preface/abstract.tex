    The contents of this work focus on detecting exoplanets in the \nir{}.

    It starts of with reduction of \nir{} spectra from CRIRES.\\

    In \cref{cha:direct_recovery} we approach a differential subtraction technique to separate the spectra from the faint companion.
    Contrasting the result to other recent detections.
    In \cref{cha:model_comparison} a second technique is developed in which the BD companions are attempted to be recovered from the $\nearrow$-infrared spectra by fitting to a complex model of two synthetic stellar spectra.
    Finding the technique unsuitable for the data on hand.

    Focusing on BD as they should have a stronger flux ratio than planets.

    In \cref{cha:nir_content} we change focus towards RV precision of M-dwarf starts.
    Calculating the theoretical precision of stellar spectra t.
    Useful for the next-generation of near-infrared spectrographs to detect planets around M-dwarf stars.

    Some thought on future are also provided.
