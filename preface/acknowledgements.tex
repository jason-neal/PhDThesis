First I would like to acknowledge my supportive wife and children for bearing with me and supporting me through this journey.
For all the late nights and trips away, and mentally exhausted presence; it is now finally over.\\

I would like to acknowledge my supervisors for their patience, wisdom, support and guidance throughout these last four years.\\

I acknowledge support from Funda\c{c}\~{a}o para a Ci\^encia e a Tecnologia (FCT) though the PhD::Space fellowship PD/BD/52700/2014. Without this fellowship we would not have moved halfway around the world to come to Portugal and undertake this research.\\
