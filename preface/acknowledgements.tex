    First I would like to thank my supportive wife Jessica, and darling children Timothy and Amelia for bearing with and supporting me through this journey to a distant land.
    For all the late nights and trips away, and a mentally exhausted presence; it is now finally over.\\
    
    I would also like to thank my supervisors, Pedro, Claudio and team leader Nuno for their patience, wisdom, support and guidance throughout these last four years.\\
    
    I acknowledge support from Funda\c{c}\~{a}o para a Ci\^encia e a Tecnologia (FCT) though the PhD::Space fellowship {PD/BD/52700/2014}.
    I was also supported by the short term contract with reference {CIAAUP-20/2018-BIM}.
    Without this funding we could not have moved halfway around the world undertake this research in Portugal.\\
    
    This work was undertaken within the Exoplanet team in the Institute de Astrof\'{\i}sica e Ci\^encias do Espa\c{c}o and Centro de Astrof\'{\i} sica da Universidade do Porto.
