First I would like to acknowledge my supportive wife Jessica, and children Timothy and Amelia for bearing with me and supporting me through this journey to a distant land.
For all the late nights and trips away, and a mentally exhausted presence; it is now finally over.\\

I would also like to acknowledge my supervisors and group leader, Pedro, Claudio and Nuno for their patience, wisdom, support and guidance throughout these last four years.\\

I acknowledge support from Funda\c{c}\~{a}o para a Ci\^encia e a Tecnologia (FCT) though the PhD::Space fellowship PD/BD/52700/2014.
Without this fellowship we could not have moved halfway around the world to come to Portugal for me to undertake this research.
I was also supported by the short term contract with reference CIAAUP-20/2018-BIM.\\

This work was undertaken within the Exoplanet team in the Institute de Astrof\'{\i}sica e Ci\^encias do Espa\c{c}o and Centro de Astrof\'{\i} sica da Universidade do Porto.
This team was supported by Funda\c{c}\~ao para a Ci\^{e}ncia e a Tecnologia (FCT) (Portugal) research grants through Portuguese funds and from FEDER - Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional, through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionaliza\c{c}\~{a}o (POCI) by the following grants:
