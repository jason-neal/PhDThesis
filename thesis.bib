  abstract = {We present new models for low-mass stars down to the hydrogen-burning limit that consistently couple atmosphere and interior structures, thereby superseding the widely used BCAH98 models. The new models include updated molecular linelists and solar abundances, as well as atmospheric convection parameters calibrated on 2D/3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations. Comparison of these models with observations in various colour-magnitude diagrams for various ages shows significant improvement over previous generations of models. The new models can solve flaws that are present in the previous ones, such as the prediction of optical colours that are too blue compared to M dwarf observations. They can also reproduce the four components of the young quadruple system LkCa 3 in a colour-magnitude diagram with one single isochrone, in contrast to any presently existing model. In this paper we also highlight the need for consistency when comparing models and observations, with the necessity of using evolutionary models and colours based on the same atmospheric structures.},

We also present evolutionary models for irradiated planets, coupling for the first time irradiated atmosphere profiles and inner structures. We focus on HD 209458-like systems and show that irradiation effects can substantially affect the radius of sub-jovian mass giant planets. Irradiation effects, however, cannot alone explain the large observed radius of HD 209458b. Adopting assumptions which optimise irradiation effects and taking into account the extension of the outer atmospheric layers, we still find \$$\backslash$sim\$ 20\% discrepancy between observed and theoretical radii. An extra source of energy seems to be required to explain the observed value of the first transit planet.},

  abstract = {The discovery of 9 new brown-dwarf candidates orbiting stars in the CORALIE and HARPS radial-velocity surveys is reported. New CORALIE radial velocities yielding accurate orbits of 6 previously-known hosts of potential brown-dwarf companions are presented. Including targets selected from the literature, 33 hosts of potential brown-dwarf companions are examined. Employing innovative methods, we use the new reduction of the Hipparcos data to fully characterise the astrometric orbits of 6 objects, revealing M-dwarf companions with masses between 90 M\_Jup and 0.52 M\_Sun. Additionally, the masses of two companions can be restricted to the stellar domain. The companion to HD 137510 is found to be a brown dwarf. At 95 \% confidence, the companion of HD 190228 is also a brown dwarf. The remaining 23 companions persist as brown-dwarf candidates. Based on the CORALIE planet-search sample, we obtain an upper limit of 0.6 \% for the frequency of brown-dwarf companions around Sun-like stars. We find that the companion-mass distribution function is rising at the lower end of the brown-dwarf mass range, suggesting that in fact we are detecting the high-mass tail of the planetary distribution.},

obtain simultaneously the Doppler shift of the two components of

observed spectrum against combinations of the two template spectra, with
all possible shifts. Thus, the correlation is a two-dimensional function
whose two independent variables are the two shifts of the two
components. The location of the maximum of this function corresponds to
the actual shifts of the two components. The technique is made feasible
through the use of an Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. TODCOR
improves the analysis of binary spectra with small velocity differences,
which are difficult to analyze with the original cross correlation. The
new algorithm was tested with numerous simulated spectra. We were able
to derive the correct velocities of the two components in all cases, one
of which is presented.},

  abstract = {One of the characteristic features of low-mass stars is their propensity to shed large amounts of angular momentum throughout their evolution. This distinguishs them from brown dwarfs which remain fast rotators over timescales of gigayears. Brown dwarfs with rotation periods longer than a couple of days have only been found in star forming regions and young clusters. This is a useful constraint on the mass dependency of mechanisms for angular momentum regular in stars. Rotational braking by disks and winds become highly inefficient in the substellar regime. In this short review I discuss the observational evidence for the fast rotation in brown dwarfs, the implications, and the link to the spin-mass relation in planets.},

  abstract = {We present a modular, extensible likelihood framework for spectroscopic inference based on synthetic model spectra. The subtraction of an imperfect model from a continuously sampled spectrum introduces covariance between adjacent datapoints (pixels) into the residual spectrum. For the high signal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in stellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically underestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We construct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This framework specifically address the common problem of mismatches in model spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model imperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity prescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that identifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line "outliers." By fitting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to synthetic spectral libraries. An open-source software implementation of this approach is available at http://iancze.github.io/Starfish, including a sophisticated probabilistic scheme for spectral interpolation when using model libraries that are sparsely sampled in the stellar parameters. We demonstrate some salient features of the framework by fitting the high resolution \$V\$-band spectrum of WASP-14, an F5 dwarf with a transiting exoplanet, and the moderate resolution \$K\$-band spectrum of Gliese 51, an M5 field dwarf.},

These standards are now routinely used for the wavelength calibration of the cryogenic infrared echelle spectrograph (CRIRES) operated at one of the unit telescopes of the very large telescope (VLT) at ESO's La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile. The availability of highly accurate wavelength standards from a commercially available calibration source permits a shift to a new operational paradigm for high-resolution IR spectroscopy. Wavelength calibration no longer has to rely on atmospheric features but can make use of laboratory traceable reference data as is normally done in the ultraviolet and visible regions. This opens the door for more quantitative spectroscopic work in the near-IR. To illustrate the potential impact of this development, we briefly review the current state of affairs in IR astronomy and its projected future. With the advent of the next generation of extremely large ground-based telescopes the IR region will become the most powerful window on the universe within the next 10\textendash{}15 years.

  abstract = {A line-by-line model (LBLRTM) has been applied to the calculation of clear-sky longwave fluxes and cooling rates for atmospheres including CO2, O3, CH4, N2O, CCl4, CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-22 in addition to water vapor. The present paper continues the approach developed in an earlier article in which the radiative properties of atmospheres with water vapor alone were reported. Tropospheric water vapor continues to be of principal importance for the longwave region due to the spectral extent of its absorbing properties, while the absorption bands of other trace species have influence over limited spectral domains. The principal effects of adding carbon dioxide are to reduce the role of the water vapor in the lower troposphere and to provide 72\% of the 13.0 K d-1 cooling rate at the stratopause. In general, the introduction of uniformly mixed trace species into atmospheres with significant amounts of water vapor has the effect of reducing the cooling associated with water vapor, providing an apparent net atmospheric heating. The radiative consequences of doubling carbon dioxide from the present level are consistent with these results. For the midlatitude summer atmosphere the heating associated with ozone that occurs from 500 to 20 mbar reaches a maximum of 0.25 K d-1 at 50 mbar and partially offsets the cooling of 1.0 K d-1 contributed by H2O and CO2 at this level. In the stratosphere the 704 cm-1 band of ozone, not included in many radiation models, contributes 25\% of the ozone cooling rate. Radiative effects associated with anticipated 10-year constituent profile changes, 1990\textendash{}2000, are presented from both a spectral and spectrally integrated perspective. The effect of the trace gases has been studied for three atmospheres: tropical, midlatitude summer, and midlatitude winter. Using these results and making a reasonable approximation for the polar regions, we obtain a value for the longwave flux at the top of the atmosphere of 265.5 W m-2, in close agreement with the clear-sky Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. This agreement provides strong support for the present approach as a reference method for the study of radiative effects resulting from changes in the distributions of trace species on global radiative forcing. Many of the results from the spectral calculations reported here are archived at the Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center for use by the community.},

Over the course of more than a decade, measurements of its orbital inclination have been announced and refuted, and have hitherto remained elusive. Here we report the detection of carbon monoxide absorption in the thermal dayside spectrum of $\tau$
Bo\"otis b. At a spectral resolution of \textasciitilde{}100,000, we trace the change in the radial velocity of the planet over a large range in phase, determining an orbital inclination of 44.5$^\circ$ +/- 1.5$^\circ$ and a mass
5.95 +/- 0.28 times that of Jupiter, demonstrating that atmospheric characterization is possible for non-transiting planets. The strong absorption signal points to an atmosphere with a temperature that is decreasing towards higher altitudes, in contrast to the temperature inversion inferred for other highly irradiated planets. This supports the hypothesis that the absorbing compounds believed to cause such atmospheric inversions are destroyed in $\tau$ Bo\"otis b by the
ultraviolet emission from the active host star.},

  abstract = {Context. In recent years, ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has 
become a powerful tool for investigating exoplanet atmospheres. It
allows the robust identification of molecular species, and it can be
applied to both transiting and non-transiting planets. Radial-velocity
measurements of the star HD 179949 indicate the presence of a giant
planet companion in a close-in orbit. The system is bright enough to be
an ideal target for near-infrared, high-resolution spectroscopy. 
Aims: Here we present the analysis of spectra of the system at 2.3
$\mu$m, obtained at a resolution of R \textasciitilde{} 100 000, during three nights of
observations with CRIRES at the VLT. We targeted the system while the
exoplanet was near superior conjunction, aiming to detect the planet's
thermal spectrum and the radial component of its orbital velocity. Methods: Unlike the telluric signal, the planet signal is subject to
a changing Doppler shift during the observations. This is due to the
changing radial component of the planet orbital velocity, which is on
the order of 100-150 km s-1 for these hot Jupiters. We can
therefore effectively remove the telluric absorption while preserving
the planet signal, which is then extracted from the data by cross
correlation with a range of model spectra for the planet atmosphere. Results: We detect molecular absorption from carbon monoxide and
water vapor with a combined signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 6.3, at a
projected planet orbital velocity of KP = (142.8 $\pm$
3.4) km s-1, which translates into a planet mass of
MP = (0.98 $\pm$ 0.04) Jupiter masses, and an orbital
inclination of i = (67.7 $\pm$ 4.3) degrees, using the known stellar
radial velocity and stellar mass. The detection of absorption features
rather than emission means that, despite being highly irradiated, HD
179949 b does not have an atmospheric temperature inversion in the
probed range of pressures and temperatures. Since the host star is
active (R'HK $>$ -4.9), this is in line with the
hypothesis that stellar activity damps the onset of thermal inversion
layers owing to UV flux photo-dissociating high-altitude, optical
absorbers. Finally, our analysis favors an oxygen-rich atmosphere for HD
179949 b, although a carbon-rich planet cannot be statistically ruled
out based on these data alone.

This theory can now be confronted with observations directly in various observational diagrams (color-color, color-magnitude, mass-magnitude, mass-spectral type), a stringent and unavoidable constraint which became possible only recently, with the generation of synthetic spectra. In this paper, we present the current state-of-the-art general theory of low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects, from one solar mass to one Jupiter mass, regarding primarily their interior structure and evolution. This review is a natural complement to the previous review on the atmosphere of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (Allard et al 1997). Special attention is devoted to the comparison of the theory with various available observations. The contribution of low-mass stellar and sub-stellar objects to the Galactic mass budget is also analysed.},

  abstract = {Context: In the near future, new instruments such as ESPRESSO will arrive, allowing us to reach a precision in radial-velocity measurements on the order of 10 cm/s. At this level of precision, several noise sources that until now have been outweighed by photon noise will start to contribute significantly to the error budget. The telluric lines that are not neglected by the masks for the radial velocity computation, here called micro-telluric lines, are one such noise source. Aims: In this work we investigate the impact of micro-telluric lines in the radial velocities calculations. We also investigate how to correct the effect of these atmospheric lines on radial velocities. Methods: The work presented here follows two parallel lines. First, we calculated the impact of the micro-telluric lines by multiplying a synthetic solar-like stellar spectrum by synthetic atmospheric spectra and evaluated the effect created by the presence of the telluric lines. Then, we divided HARPS spectra by synthetic atmospheric spectra to correct for its presence on real data and calculated the radial velocity on the corrected spectra. When doing so, one considers two atmospheric models for the synthetic atmospheric spectra: the LBLRTM and TAPAS. Results: We find that the micro-telluric lines can induce an impact on the radial velocities calculation that can already be close to the current precision achieved with HARPS, and so its effect should not be neglected, especially for future instruments such as ESPRESSO. Moreover, we find that the micro-telluric lines' impact depends on factors, such as the radial velocity of the star, airmass, relative humidity, and the barycentric Earth radial velocity projected along the line of sight at the time of the observation.},

  abstract = {Giant exoplanets orbiting very close to their parent star (hot Jupiters) are subject to tidal forces expected to synchronize their rotational and orbital periods on short timescales (tidal locking). However, spin rotation has never been measured directly for hot Jupiters. Furthermore, their atmospheres can show equatorial super-rotation via strong eastward jet streams, and/or high-altitude winds flowing from the day- to the night-side hemisphere. Planet rotation and atmospheric circulation broaden and distort the planet spectral lines to an extent that is detectable with measurements at high spectral resolution. We observed a transit of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b around 2.3 \{$\backslash$mu\}m and at a spectral resolution of R\textasciitilde{}10\$\^5\$ with CRIRES at the ESO Very Large Telescope. After correcting for the stellar absorption lines and their distortion during transit (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect), we detect the absorption of carbon monoxide and water vapor in the planet transmission spectrum by cross-correlating with model spectra. The signal is maximized (7.6\{$\backslash$sigma\}) for a planet rotational velocity of \$(3.4\^\{+1.3\}\_\{-2.1\})\$ km/s, corresponding to a rotational period of \$(1.7\^\{+2.9\}\_\{-0.4\})\$ days. This is consistent with the planet orbital period of 2.2 days and therefore with tidal locking. We find that the rotation of HD 189733 b is longer than 1 day (3\{$\backslash$sigma\}). The data only marginally (1.5\{$\backslash$sigma\}) prefer models with rotation versus models without rotation. We measure a small day- to night-side wind speed of \$(-1.7\^\{+1.1\}\_\{-1.2\})\$ km/s. Compared to the recent detection of sodium blue-shifted by (8\$$\backslash$pm\$2) km/s, this likely implies a strong vertical wind shear between the pressures probed by near-infrared and optical transmission spectroscopy.},

for the observer. Strong molecular absorptions from species whose
concentrations vary with time can be particularly challenging to remove
precisely. Yet removing these effects is key to accurately determining
the composition of many astronomical objects - planetary atmospheres in
particular. Here, we present a method for removing telluric effects
based on a modelling approach. The method relies only on observations
usually made by the planetary astronomer, and so is directly comparable
with current techniques. We use the modelling approach to process
observations made of Jupiter, and Saturn's moon Titan and compare the
results with those of the standard telluric division technique, finding
the modelling approach to have distinct advantages even in conditions
regarded as ideal for telluric division.},

  abstract = {We present the full results of our decade-long astrometric monitoring programs targeting 31 ultracool binaries with component spectral types M7-T5. Joint analysis of resolved imaging from Keck Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope and unresolved astrometry from CFHT/WIRCam yields parallactic distances for all systems, robust orbit determinations for 23 systems, and photocenter orbits for 19 systems. As a result, we measure 38 precise individual masses spanning 30-115 \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$. We determine a model-independent substellar boundary that is \$$\backslash$approx\$70 \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$ in mass (\$$\backslash$approx\$L4 in spectral type), and we validate Baraffe et al. (2015) evolutionary model predictions for the lithium-depletion boundary (60 \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$ at field ages). Assuming each binary is coeval, we test models of the substellar mass-luminosity relation and find that in the L/T transition, only the Saumon \& Marley (2008) "hybrid" models accounting for cloud clearing match our data. We derive a precise, mass-calibrated spectral type-effective temperature relation covering 1100-2800 K. Our masses enable a novel direct determination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs spanning L4-T5 and 30-70 \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$. We determine a median age of 1.3 Gyr, and our population synthesis modeling indicates our sample is consistent with a constant star formation history modulated by dynamical heating in the Galactic disk. We discover two triple-brown-dwarf systems, the first with directly measured masses and eccentricities. We examine the eccentricity distribution, carefully considering biases and completeness, and find that low-eccentricity orbits are significantly more common among ultracool binaries than solar-type binaries, possibly indicating the early influence of long-lived dissipative gas disks. Overall, this work represents a major advance in the empirical view of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Their relative importance probably depends on environment, and should be judged by their ability to reproduce the brown dwarf IMF, the distribution and kinematics of newly formed brown dwarfs, the binary statistics of brown dwarfs, the ability of brown dwarfs to retain disks, and hence their ability to sustain accretion and outflows. This will require more sophisticated numerical modeling than is presently possible, in particular more realistic initial conditions and more realistic treatments of radiation transport, angular momentum transport, and magnetic fields. We discuss the minimum mass for brown dwarfs, and how brown dwarfs should be distinguished from planets.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the Hipparcos astrometric observations of 47 stars that were discovered to harbor giant planets and 14 stars with brown dwarf secondary candidates. The Hipparcos measurements were used together with the corresponding stellar radial velocity data to derive an astrometric orbit for each system. To find out the significance of the derived astrometric orbits, we applied a "permutation" technique by which we analyzed the permuted Hipparcos data to get false orbits. The size distribution of these false orbits indicated the range of possibly random, false orbits that could be derived from the true data. These tests could not find any astrometric orbit of the planet candidates with significance higher than 99\%, suggesting that most if not all orbits are not real. Instead, we used the Hipparcos data to set upper limits on the masses of the planet candidates. The lowest derived upper limit is that of 47 UMa\textemdash{}0.014 M $\Sun$ , which confirms the planetary nature of its unseen companion. For 13 other planet candidates, the upper limits exclude the stellar nature of their companions, although brown dwarf secondaries are still an option. These negate the idea that all or most of the extrasolar planets are disguised stellar secondaries. Of the 14 brown dwarf candidates, our analysis reproduced the results of Halbwachs et al., who derived significant astrometric orbits for six systems that imply secondaries with stellar masses. We show that another star, HD 164427, which was discovered only very recently, also has a secondary with stellar mass. Our findings support Halbwachs et al.'s conclusion about the possible existence of the "brown dwarf desert" that separates the planets and the stellar secondaries.},

  abstract = {We have found a very faint companion to the active solar analog HR 7672 (HD 190406; GJ 779; 15 Sge). Three epochs of high-resolution imaging using adaptive optics (AO) at the Gemini-North and Keck II Telescopes demonstrate that HR 7672B is a common proper motion companion, with a separation of 0 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] farcs 79 (14 AU) and a 2.16 $\mu$m flux ratio of 8.6 mag. Using follow-up K -band spectroscopy from Keck AO+NIRSPEC, we measure a spectral type of L45 with an uncertainty of $\pm$1.5 subclasses. This is the closest ultracool companion around a main-sequence star found to date by direct imaging. We estimate that the primary has an age of 1-3 Gyr. Assuming coevality, the companion is most likely substellar, with a mass of 55-78 M J based on theoretical models. The primary star shows a long-term radial velocity trend, and we combine the radial velocity data and AO imaging to set a firm (model-independent) lower limit of 48 M J . In contrast to the paucity of brown dwarf companions at \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] lesssim 4 AU around FGK dwarfs, HR 7672B implies that brown dwarf companions do exist at separations comparable to those of the giant planets in our own solar system. Its presence is at variance with scenarios in which brown dwarfs form as ejected stellar embryos. Moreover, since HR 7672B is likely too massive to have formed in a circumstellar disk as planets are believed to, its discovery suggests that a diversity of physical processes act to populate the outer regions of exoplanetary systems.},

We then use observations of these populations to test theories of star formation and evolution at low masses. For comparison to the formation models, we consider the initial mass function, stellar multiplicity, circumstellar disks, protostellar characteristics, and kinematic and spatial distributions at birth for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. To test the evolutionary models, we focus on measurements of dynamical masses and empirical Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for young brown dwarfs and planetary companions.},

  abstract = {M-dwarf stars are the most numerous stars in the Universe; they span a wide range in mass and are in the focus of ongoing and planned exoplanet surveys. To investigate and understand their physical nature, detailed spectral information and accurate stellar models are needed. We use a new synthetic atmosphere model generation and compare model spectra to observations. To test the model accuracy, we compared the models to four benchmark stars with atmospheric parameters for which independent information from interferometric radius measurements is available. We used \$$\backslash$chi\^2\$ -based methods to determine parameters from high-resolution spectroscopic observations. Our synthetic spectra are based on the new PHOENIX grid that uses the ACES description for the equation of state. This is a model generation expected to be especially suitable for the low-temperature atmospheres. We identified suitable spectral tracers of atmospheric parameters and determined the uncertainties in \$T\_\{$\backslash$rm eff\}\$, \$$\backslash$log\{g\}\$, and [Fe/H] resulting from degeneracies between parameters and from shortcomings of the model atmospheres. The inherent uncertainties we find are \{$\backslash$sigma\}\$T\_\{$\backslash$rm eff\}\$= 35 K, \{$\backslash$sigma\}\$$\backslash$log\{g\}\$ = 0.14, and \{$\backslash$sigma\}[Fe/H] = 0.11. The new model spectra achieve a reliable match to our observed data; our results for \$T\_\{$\backslash$rm eff\}\$ and \$$\backslash$log\{g\}\$ are consistent with literature values to within 1\{$\backslash$sigma\}. However, metallicities reported from earlier photometric and spectroscopic calibrations in some cases disagree with our results by more than 3 \{$\backslash$sigma\}. A possible explanation are systematic errors in earlier metallicity determinations that were based on insufficient descriptions of the cool atmospheres. At this point, however, we cannot definitely identify the reason for this discrepancy, but our analysis indicates that there is a large uncertainty in the accuracy of M-dwarf parameter estimates.},

Unfortunately, model calibrations in (young) ultralow-mass objects are rare. As a first step towards a calibration of synthetic spectral features, I show molecular bands of TiO, which is a main opacity source in late M-dwarfs. The TiO $\epsilon$ -band at 8450 \AA{} is systematically too weak.

  abstract = {Since the discovery of brown dwarfs in 1994, and the discovery of dust cloud formation in the latest Very Low Mass Stars (VLMs) and Brown Dwarfs (BDs) in 1996, the most important challenge in modeling their atmospheres as become the understanding of cloud formation and advective mixing. For this purpose, we have developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations to study the formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, and sedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs to BDs sequence (Teff = 2800 K to 900 K, Freytag et al. 2010). We discovered the formation of gravity waves as a driving mechanism for the formation of clouds in these atmospheres, and derived a rule for the velocity field versus atmospheric depth and Teff , which is relatively insensitive to gravity. This rule has been used in the construction of the new model atmosphere grid, BT-Settl, to determine the microturbulence velocity, the diffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of molecules as a function of depth. This new model grid of atmospheres and synthetic spectra has beencomputedfor100,000K$>$Teff $>$400K,5.5$>$logg$>$-0.5,and[M/H]=+0.5to -1.5, and the reference solar abundances of Asplund et al. (2009). We found that the new solar abundances allow an improved (close to perfect) reproduction of the photo- metric and spectroscopic VLMs properties, and, for the first time, a smooth transition between stellar and substellar regimes -- unlike the transition between the NextGen models from Hauschildt et al. 1999a,b, and the AMES-Dusty models from Allard et al. 2001). In the BDs regime, the BT-Settl models propose an improved explanation for the M-L-T spectral transition. In this paper, we therefore present the new BT-Settl model atmosphere grid, which explains the entire transition from the stellar to planetary mass regimes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a spectral differential technique with which the dynamical mass of low-mass companions can be found. This method aims at discovering close companions to late-type stars by removing the stellar spectrum through a subtraction of spectra obtained at different orbital phases and discovering the companion spectrum in the difference spectrum in which the companion lines appear twice (positive and negative signal). The resulting radial velocity difference of these two signals provides the true mass of the companion, if the orbital solution for the radial velocities of the primary is known. We select the CO line region in the K band for our study, because it provides a favourable star-to-companion brightness ratio for our test case GJ 1046, an M2V dwarf with a low-mass companion that most likely is a brown dwarf. Furthermore, these lines remain largely unblended in the difference spectrum so that the radial velocity amplitude of the companion can be measured directly. Only if the companion rotates rapidly and has a small radial velocity due to a high mass, does blending occur for all lines so that our approach fails. We also consider activity of the host star, and show that the companion difference flux can be expected to have larger amplitude than the residual signal from the active star so that stellar activity does not inhibit the determination of the companion mass. In addition to determining the companion mass, we restore the single companion spectrum from the difference spectrum using singular value decomposition.

  abstract = {Although the formalism of Lecavelier des Etangs et~al. is extremely useful to understand what shapes transmission spectra of exoplanets, it does not include the effects of a sharp change in flux with altitude generally associated with surfaces and optically thick clouds. Recent advances in understanding the effects of refraction in exoplanet transmission spectra have, however, demonstrated that even clear thick atmospheres have such a sharp change in flux due to a refractive boundary. We derive a more widely applicable analytical formalism by including first-order effects from all these `surfaces' to compute an exoplanet's effective radius, effective atmospheric thickness and spectral modulation for an atmosphere with a constant scaleheight. We show that the effective radius cannot be located below these `surfaces' and that our formalism matches the formalism of Lecavelier des Etangs et~al. in the case of a clear atmosphere. Our formalism explains why clouds and refraction reduce the contrast of spectral features, and why refraction decreases the Rayleigh scattering slope as wavelength increases, but also shows that these are common effects of all `surfaces'. We introduce the concept of a `surface' cross-section, the minimum mean cross-section that can be observed, as an index to characterize the location of `surfaces' and provide a simple method to estimate their effects on the spectral modulation of homogeneous atmospheres. We finally devise a numerical recipe that extends our formalism to atmospheres with a non-constant scaleheight and arbitrary sources of opacity, a potentially necessary step to interpret observations.},

  abstract = {Measurements of radial velocity variations from the spectroscopic monitoring of stars and their companions are essential for a broad swath of astrophysics; these measurements provide access to the fundamental physical properties that dictate all phases of stellar evolution and facilitate the quantitative study of planetary systems. The conversion of those measurements into both constraints on the orbital architecture and individual component spectra can be a serious challenge, however, especially for extreme flux ratio systems and observations with relatively low sensitivity. Gaussian processes define sampling distributions of flexible, continuous functions that are well-motivated for modeling stellar spectra, enabling proficient searches for companion lines in time-series spectra. We introduce a new technique for spectral disentangling, where the posterior distributions of the orbital parameters and intrinsic, rest-frame stellar spectra are explored simultaneously without needing to invoke cross-correlation templates. To demonstrate its potential, this technique is deployed on red-optical time-series spectra of the mid-M-dwarf binary LP661-13. We report orbital parameters with improved precision compared to traditional radial velocity analysis and successfully reconstruct the primary and secondary spectra. We discuss potential applications for other stellar and exoplanet radial velocity techniques and extensions to time-variable spectra. The code used in this analysis is freely available as an open-source Python package.},

  abstract = {The ability to perform detailed chemical analysis of Sun-like F-, G-, and K-type stars is a powerful tool with many applications including studying the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and constraining planet formation theories. Unfortunately, complications in modeling cooler stellar atmospheres hinders similar analysis of M-dwarf stars. Empirically-calibrated methods to measure M dwarf metallicity from moderate-resolution spectra are currently limited to measuring overall metallicity and rely on astrophysical abundance correlations in stellar populations. We present a new, empirical calibration of synthetic M dwarf spectra that can be used to infer effective temperature, Fe abundance, and Ti abundance. We obtained high-resolution (R\textasciitilde{}25,000), Y-band (\textasciitilde{}1 micron) spectra of 29 M dwarfs with NIRSPEC on Keck II. Using the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere modeling code (version 15.5), we generated a grid of synthetic spectra covering a range of temperatures, metallicities, and alpha-enhancements. From our observed and synthetic spectra, we measured the equivalent widths of multiple Fe I and Ti I lines and a temperature-sensitive index based on the FeH bandhead. We used abundances measured from widely-separated solar-type companions to empirically calibrate transformations to the observed indices and equivalent widths that force agreement with the models. Our calibration achieves precisions in Teff, [Fe/H], and [Ti/Fe] of 60 K, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively and is calibrated for 3200 K $<$ Teff $<$ 4100 K, -0.7 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ +0.3, and -0.05 $<$ [Ti/Fe] $<$ +0.3. This work is a step toward detailed chemical analysis of M dwarfs at a similar precision achieved for FGK stars.},

  abstract = {In contrast to planets with masses similar to that of Jupiter and higher, the bulk compositions of planets in the so-called super-Earth regime (masses 2-10 times that of the Earth) cannot be uniquely
determined from a measurement of mass and radius alone. For these planets, there is a degeneracy between the mass and composition of both the interior and a possible atmosphere in theoretical models. The recently discovered transiting super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b is one example of this problem. Three distinct models for the planet that are consistent with its mass and radius have been suggested. Breaking the degeneracy between these models requires obtaining constraints on the planet's atmospheric composition. Here we report a ground-based
measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b between wavelengths of 780 and 1,000nm. The lack of features in this spectrum rules out (at 4.9$\sigma$ confidence) cloud-free atmospheres composed primarily of
hydrogen. If the planet's atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, then it must contain clouds or hazes that are optically thick at the observed wavelengths at pressures less than 200mbar. Alternatively, the
featureless transmission spectrum is also consistent with the presence of a dense, water vapour atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The mass domain where massive extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs overlap is still poorly understood due to the paucity of brown dwarfs orbiting close to solar-type stars, the so-called brown dwarf desert. In this paper, we collect all available data about close brown dwarfs around solar-type stars and their host stars from literature and study the demographics of the brown dwarf desert. The data clearly show a short period and a medium mass gap in the brown dwarf period-mass distribution diagram (35 $<$ m sin i $<$ 55M\textsubscript{Jup} and P $<$ 100 d), representing the ‘driest land' in the brown dwarf desert. Observation biases are highly unlikely to cause this gap due to its short period and medium mass, of which brown dwarfs can be easily detected by previous radial velocity surveys. Brown dwarfs above and below this gap have significantly different eccentricity distribution, which not only confirms that this gap is real, but also implies that they may have different origins. Our further statistical study indicates that brown dwarfs below this gap may primarily form in the protoplanetary disc through disc gravitational instability, while brown dwarfs above this gap may dominantly form like a stellar binary through molecular cloud fragmentation. Our discoveries have offered important insights about brown dwarf formation mechanisms and their possible relationships with planet and star formation.},

Nevertheless, we suspect that observational biases could also impact transiting-planet hosts. Aims: This paper aims to evaluate how selection effects reflect on the evolutionary stage of both a limited sample of transiting-planet host stars (TPH) and a wider sample of planet-hosting stars detected through radial velocity analysis. Then, thanks to uniform derivation of stellar ages, a homogeneous comparison between exoplanet hosts and field star age distributions is developed. Methods: Stellar parameters have been computed through our custom-developed isochrone placement algorithm, according to Padova evolutionary models. The notable aspects of our algorithm include the treatment of element diffusion, activity checks in terms of
log\{R'HK\} and vsini, and the evaluation of the stellar evolutionary speed in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram in order to better constrain age. Working with TPH, the observational stellar mean density $\rho\star$ allows us to compute stellar luminosity even if
the distance is not available, by combining $\rho\star$ with
the spectroscopic log g. Results: The median value of the TPH ages is 5 Gyr. Even if this sample is not very large, however the result is very similar to what we found for the sample of spectroscopic hosts, whose modal and median values are [3, 3.5) Gyr and 4.8 Gyr, respectively. Thus, these stellar samples suffer almost the same selection effects. An analysis of MS stars of the solar neighbourhood belonging to the same spectral types bring to an age distribution similar to the previous ones and centered around solar age value. Therefore, the age of our Sun is consistent with the age distribution of solar neighbourhood stars with spectral types from late F to early K, regardless of whether they harbour planets or not. We considered the possibility that our selected samples are older than the average disc population.},

  abstract = {Context. Planetary companions of a fixed mass induce reflex motions with 
a larger amplitude around lower-mass stars, which adds to making M
dwarfs excellent targets for extra-solar planet searches. The most
recent velocimeters with a stability of \textasciitilde{}1 m s-1 can detect
very low-mass planets out to the habitable zone of these stars. Low-mass
small planets are abundant around M dwarfs, and most of the known
potentially habitable planets orbit one of these cool stars. 
Aims: Our M-dwarf radial velocity monitoring with HARPS on the ESO 3.6 m
telescope at La Silla observatory makes a major contribution to this
sample. Methods: We present here dense radial velocity (RV) time
series for three M dwarfs observed over \textasciitilde{}five years: GJ 3293 (0.42
M$\odot$), GJ 3341 (0.47 M$\odot$), and GJ 3543 (0.45
M$\odot$). We extracted these RVs through minimum
$\chi$2-matching of each spectrum against a stack of all
observed spectra for the same star that has a high signal-to-noise
ratio. We then compared potential orbital signals against several
stellar activity indicators to distinguish the Keplerian variations
induced by planets from the spurious signals that result from rotational
modulation of stellar surface inhomogeneities and from activity cycles.
 Results: Two Neptune-mass planets - msin(i) = 1.4 $\pm$ 0.1
and 1.3 $\pm$ 0.1Mnept - orbit GJ 3293 with periods P =
30.60 $\pm$ 0.02 d and P = 123.98 $\pm$ 0.38 d, possibly together
with a super-Earth - msin(i) \textasciitilde{} 7.9 $\pm$ 1.4 M$\oplus$ -
with period P = 48.14 $\pm$ 0.12d. A super-Earth - msin(i) \textasciitilde{} 6.1
M$\oplus$ - orbits GJ 3341 with P = 14.207 $\pm$ 0.007d.
The RV variations of GJ 3543, on the other hand, reflect its stellar
activity rather than planetary signals.

Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

  abstract = {High resolution (R=110000), very high S/N spectra, centered on the 6707.8A LiI line have been obtained with the ESO Coude Echelle Spectrometer for five, metal-poor (-0.8 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ -0.6) disk stars in the turnoff region of the HR-diagram. The instrumental and stellar atmospheric line broadening have been determined from two unblended iron lines and used in a model atmosphere synthesis of the profile of the LiI line as a function of the lithium isotope ratio. This has led to a detection of 6Li in HD68284 and HD130551 with 6Li/7Li = 0.05, whereas the other stars, HR2883, HR3578 and HR8181, have 6Li/7Li close to zero. By comparing Teff-values and absolute magnitudes based on Hipparcos parallaxes with recent stellar evolutionary tracks, the masses of the stars have been derived. It is shown that the two stars with 6Li present have a significantly higher mass, M = 1.05 M(sun), than the other three stars for which values between 0.85 and 1.0 M(sun) are obtained. The results are discussed in terms of models for the galactic evolution of the light elements and depletion of the lithium isotopes in stellar envelopes. It is shown that the measured 6Li abundances are in agreement with standard cosmic ray production of 6Li in the galactic disk and a moderate depletion (0.5 dex) in the stars. Recent models for the evolution of 6Li including alpha + alpha fusion reactions and predicting a high lithium isotopic ratio, 6Li/7Li = 0.3 at [Fe/H] = -0.6, require a high degree of 6Li depletion (1.0 dex) to fit the observations. Furthermore, these models imply a 7Li abundance about 0.2 dex higher than observed for metal-poor disk stars.},

  abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the CARMENES instrument and of the survey that will be carried out with it during the first years of operation. CARMENES (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs) is a next-generation radial-velocity instrument under construction for the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory by a consortium of eleven Spanish and German institutions. The scientific goal of the project is conducting a 600-night exoplanet survey targeting \textasciitilde{} 300 M dwarfs with the completed instrument. The CARMENES instrument consists of two separate echelle spectrographs covering the wavelength range from 0.55 to 1.7 $\mu$m at a spectral resolution of R = 82,000, fed by fibers from the Cassegrain focus of the telescope. The spectrographs are housed in vacuum tanks providing the temperature-stabilized environments necessary to enable a 1 m/s radial velocity precision employing a simultaneous calibration with an emission-line lamp or with a Fabry-Perot etalon. For mid-M to late-M spectral types, the wavelength range around 1.0 $\mu$m (Y band) is the most important wavelength region for radial velocity work. Therefore, the efficiency of CARMENES has been optimized in this range. The CARMENES instrument consists of two spectrographs, one equipped with a 4k x 4k pixel CCD for the range 0.55 - 1.05 $\mu$m, and one with two 2k x 2k pixel HgCdTe detectors for the range from 0.95 - 1.7$\mu$m. Each spectrograph will be coupled to the 3.5m telescope with two optical fibers, one for the target, and one for calibration light. The front end contains a dichroic beam splitter and an atmospheric dispersion
corrector, to feed the light into the fibers leading to the
spectrographs. Guiding is performed with a separate camera; on-axis as well as off-axis guiding modes are implemented. Fibers with octagonal cross-section are employed to ensure good stability of the output in the presence of residual guiding errors. The fibers are continually actuated to reduce modal noise. The spectrographs are mounted on benches inside vacuum tanks located in the coud\'e laboratory of the 3.5m dome.
Each vacuum tank is equipped with a temperature stabilization system capable of keeping the temperature constant to within +/-0.01$^\circ$C over 24 hours. The visible-light spectrograph will be operated near room temperature, while the near-IR spectrograph will be cooled to \textasciitilde{} 140 K. The CARMENES instrument passed its final design review in February 2013. The MAIV phase is currently ongoing. First tests at the telescope are scheduled for early 2015. Completion of the full instrument is planned for the fall of 2015. At least 600 useable nights have been allocated at the Calar Alto 3.5m Telescope for the CARMENES survey in the time frame until 2018. A data base of M stars (dubbed CARMENCITA) has been compiled from which the CARMENES sample can be selected. CARMENCITA contains information on all relevant properties of the potential targets. Dedicated imaging, photometric, and spectroscopic observations are underway to provide crucial data on these stars that are not available in the literature.},

  abstract = {We derive the radii of 16 brown dwarfs observed by AKARI using their parallaxes and the ratios of observed to model fluxes. We find that the brown dwarf radius ranges between 0.64-1.13 RJ with an average radius of 0.83 RJ. We find a trend in the relation between radii and Teff; the radius is at a minimum at Teff\textasciitilde{}1600 K, which corresponds to the spectral types of mid-to late-L. The result is interpreted by a combination of radius-mass and radius-age relations that are theoretically expected for brown dwarfs older than 10\^8 yr.},

  abstract = {Context. Compact hierarchical systems are important because the effects caused by the dynamical interaction among its members occur ona human timescale. These interactions play a role in the formation of close binaries through Kozai cycles with tides. One such system is $\xi$ Tauri: it has three hierarchical orbits: 7.14 d (eclipsing components Aa, Ab), 145 d (components Aa+Ab, B), and 51 yr (components Aa+Ab+B, C). \\
 Aims: We aim to obtain physical properties of the system and to study the dynamical interaction between its components. \\
 Methods: Our analysis is based on a large series of spectroscopic photometric (including space-borne) observations and long-baseline optical and infrared spectro-interferometric observations. We used two approaches to infer the system properties: a set of observation-specific models, where all components have elliptical trajectories, and an N-body model, which computes the trajectory of each component by integrating Newton's equations of motion. \\
 Results: The triple subsystem exhibits clear signs of dynamical interaction. The most pronounced are the advance of the apsidal line and eclipse-timing variations. We determined the geometry of all three orbits using both observation-specific and N-body models. The latter correctly accounted for observed effects of the dynamical interaction, predicted cyclic variations of orbital inclinations, and determined the sense of motion of all orbits. Using perturbation theory, we demonstrate that prominent secular and periodic dynamical effects are explainable with a quadrupole interaction. We constrained the basic properties of all components, especially of members of the inner triple subsystem and detected rapid low-amplitude light variations that we attribute to co-rotating surface structures of component B. We also estimated the radius of component B. Properties of component C remain uncertain because of its low relative luminosity. We provide an independent estimate of the distance to the system. \\
 Conclusions: The accuracy and consistency of our results make $\xi$ Tau an excellent test bed for models of formation and evolution of hierarchical systems.

  abstract = {Celestial bodies with a mass of M$\approx$ 10 \{M\}\{Jup\} have been 
found orbiting nearby stars. It is unknown whether these objects formed
like gas-giant planets through core accretion or like stars through
gravitational instability. I show that objects with M$\lessequivlnt$ 4
\{M\}\{Jup\} orbit metal-rich solar-type dwarf stars, a property
associated with core accretion. Objects with M$\greaterequivlnt$ 10
\{M\}\{Jup\} do not share this property. This transition is
coincident with a minimum in the occurrence rate of such objects,
suggesting that the maximum mass of a celestial body formed through core
accretion like a planet is less than 10 \{M\}\{Jup\}.
Consequently, objects with M$\greaterequivlnt$ 10 \{M\}\{Jup\} orbiting
solar-type dwarf stars likely formed through gravitational instability
and should not be thought of as planets. Theoretical models of giant
planet formation in scaled minimum-mass solar nebula
Shakura\textendash{}Sunyaev disks with standard parameters tuned to produce
giant planets predict a maximum mass nearly an order of magnitude
larger. To prevent newly formed giant planets from growing larger than
10 \{M\}\{Jup\}, protoplanetary disks must therefore be
significantly less viscous or of lower mass than typically assumed
during the runaway gas accretion stage of giant planet formation. Either
effect would act to slow the Type I/II migration of planetary
embryos/giant planets and promote their survival. These inferences are
insensitive to the host star mass, planet formation location, or
characteristic disk dissipation time.},

for objects with masses ranging from planets (M $\approx$ 0.01
MJup) to stars (M $>$ 0.08 M$\odot$). This
relationship shows three distinct regions separated by a change in slope in the log M - log $\rho$ plane. In particular, objects with masses
in the range 0.3 MJup-60 MJup follow a tight linear relationship with no distinguishing feature to separate the low-mass end (giant planets) from the high-mass end (brown dwarfs). We propose a new definition of giant planets simply based on changes in the slope of the log M versus log $\rho$ relationship. By this criterion, objects with masses less than $\approx$0.3 MJup are low-mass
planets, either icy or rocky. Giant planets cover the mass range 0.3 MJup-60 MJup. Analogous to the stellar main sequence, objects on the upper end of the giant planet sequence (brown dwarfs) can simply be referred to as ``high-mass giant
planets,'' while planets with masses near that of Jupiter can be
called ``low-mass giant planets.''},

  abstract = {In the last decade, the photospheric solar metallicity as determined from spectroscopy experienced a remarkable downward revision. Part of this effect can be attributed to an improvement of atomic data and the inclusion of NLTE computations, but also the use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to play a role. This "decrease" with time of the metallicity of the solar photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from helioseismology. With a CO \textsuperscript{5} BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere, the CIFIST team at the Paris Observatory re-determined the photospheric solar abundances of several elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances are obtained by fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile of observed spectral lines with synthetic spectra computed from the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the effects of granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few particular cases. 3D effects are not responsible for the systematic lowering of the solar abundances in recent years. The solar metallicity resulting from this analysis is Z=0.0153, Z/ X=0.0209.},

We show spectral details of cool atmospheres at very high-resolution (R $\sim$ 40 000) and compare them with synthetic spectra computed from the recent BT-Settl atmosphere models.
Results. Our comparison shows that molecular features (TiO, VO, CaH), and atomic features (Fe I, Ti I, Na I, K I) are well-fitted by current models. We produce a relation of effective temperature versus spectral type over the entire subdwarf spectral sequence. The high-resolution of our spectra unabled us to perform a detailed comparison of the line profiles of individual elements such as Fe I, Ca II, and Ti I, and we determined accurate metallicities of these stars. These determinations in turn enabled us to calibrate the relation between metallicity and molecular-band strength indices from low-resolution spectra.
Conclusions. The new generation of models is able to reproduce various spectral features of M subdwarfs. These high-resolution spectra allowed us to separate the atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, gravity, metallicity), which is not possible when using low-resolution spectroscopy or photometry.},

  abstract = {Two distinct but fully compatible novel concepts are proposed here for solar/stellar velocity measurements. The first is that of absolute accelerometry proper. This involves two simultaneously, operating servo-control loops First, a variable path-difference Fabry-Perot interferometer is adjusted so that its bandpasses track the fluctuations of either a single spectral line (in the solar case, leading to the solar accelerometer), or of all lines simultaneously (stellar accelerometer). The second loop involves a tunable laser tracking one of the FP bandpasses. The net overall result is that a laser line tracks the stellar/solar ones: the problem of measuring Doppler-shift changes has been transferred from the incoherent to the coherent optics domain. One then measures the beat frequency generated by mixing the tunable laser beam with that of stabilized laser. Only velocity changes are accessible; the devices are true accelerometers, but absolute ones. All instrumental or spectral characteristics drop out; no calibration of any kind is required; hence, one may hope for an unusually low level of systematic errors.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a new series of nongray calculations of the atmospheres, spectra, colors, and evolution of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) and brown dwarfs for effective temperatures below 1300 K. This theory encompasses most of the mass/age parameter space occupied by substellar objects and is the first spectral study down to 100 K. These calculations are in aid of the multitude of searches being conducted or planned around the world for giant planets and brown dwarfs and reveal the exotic nature of the class. Generically, absorption by H2 at longer wavelengths and H2O opacity windows at shorter wavelengths conspire to redistribute flux blueward. Below 1200 K, methane is the dominant carbon bearing molecule and is a universal diagnostic feature of EGP and brown dwarf spectra. We find that the primary bands in which to search are Z (\textasciitilde{}1.05 $\mu$m), J (\textasciitilde{}1.2 $\mu$m), H (\textasciitilde{}1.6 $\mu$m), K (\textasciitilde{}2.2 $\mu$m), M (\textasciitilde{}5 $\mu$m), and N (\textasciitilde{}10 $\mu$m), that
enhancements of the emergent flux over blackbody values, in particular in the near infrared, can be by many orders of magnitude, and that the infrared colors of EGPs and brown dwarfs are much bluer than previously believed. In particular, relative to J and H, the K band flux is reduced by CH4 and H2 absorption. Furthermore, we conclude that for Teff's below 1200 K most or all true metals may be sequestered below the photosphere, that an interior radiative zone is a generic feature of substellar objects, and that clouds of H2O and NH3 are formed for Teff's below \textasciitilde{}400 and \textasciitilde{}200 K, respectively. This study is done for solar-metallicity objects in isolation and does not include the effects of stellar insulation. Nevertheless, it is a comprehensive attempt to bridge the gap between the planetary and stellar realms and to develop a nongray theory of objects from 0.3MJ (‘‘Saturn'') to 70MJ (\textasciitilde{}0.07 M$\odot$). We find that the detection ranges for brown
dwarf/EGP discovery of both ground- and space-based telescopes are larger than previously estimated.},

derive the RVs and additional spectral diagnostics implemented in the
SpEctrum Radial Velocity AnaLyser (SERVAL), a publicly available python
code. Methods: We measured the RVs using high signal-to-noise
templates created by coadding all available spectra of each star. We
define the chromatic index as the RV gradient as a function of
wavelength with the RVs measured in the echelle orders. Additionally, we
computed the differential line width by correlating the fit residuals
with the second derivative of the template to track variations in the
stellar line width. Results: Using HARPS data, our SERVAL code
achieves a RV precision at the level of 1 m/s. Applying the chromatic
index to CARMENES data of the active star YZ CMi, we identify apparent
RV variations induced by stellar activity. The differential line width
is found to be an alternative indicator to the commonly used full width
half maximum. Conclusions: We find that at the red optical
wavelengths (700-900 nm) obtained by the visual channel of CARMENES, the
chromatic index is an excellent tool to investigate stellar active
regions and to identify and perhaps even correct for activity-induced RV
variations.},

The presence of numerous telluric absorption lines in the nIR brings an important challenge. As the star's barycentric velocity varies through the year, the telluric absorption lines effectively varies in velocity relative to the star's spectrum by the same amount leading to important systematic RV offsets. We present a novel Principal component analysis-based approach for telluric line subtraction and demonstrated its
effectiveness with archival HARPS data for GJ436 and $\tau$ Ceti, over parts of the R-band that contain strong telluric absorption lines. The main results are: 1) a better RV accuracy with excluding only a few percentage of the domain, 2) better use of the entire spectrum to measure RV and 3) a higher telescope time efficency by using A0V telluric standard from telescope archive.},

search for any orbiting planets. In this paper, we present the survey
sample by publishing one CARMENES spectrum for each M dwarf. These
spectra cover the wavelength range 520-1710 nm at a resolution of at
least R $>$80 000, and we measure its RV, H$\alpha$ emission, and
projected rotation velocity. We present an atlas of high-resolution
M-dwarf spectra and compare the spectra to atmospheric models. To
quantify the RV precision that can be achieved in low-mass stars over
the CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical information on
the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare our
high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where we determine
the spectroscopic RV information content, Q, and signal-to-noise ratio.
We find that for all M-type dwarfs, the highest RV precision can be
reached in the wavelength range 700-900 nm. Observations at longer
wavelengths are equally precise only at the very latest spectral types
(M8 and M9). We demonstrate that in this spectroscopic range, the large
amount of absorption features compensates for the intrinsic faintness of
an M7 star. To reach an RV precision of 1 m s-1 in very low
mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires the use of a 10 m
class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier, the combination of a
red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph is ideal to search for
low-mass planets and to distinguish between planets and stellar
variability. At a 4 m class telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has
the potential to push the RV precision well below the typical jitter
level of 3-4 m s-1.},

the study of exoplanets during the last two decades, from the early

now a mature field, there is currently a strong effort to push the
technique into the near-infrared domain (chiefly Y, J, H, and K
bandpasses) to probe planetary systems around late-type stars. The
combined lower mass and luminosity of M dwarfs leads to an increased
reflex RV signal for planets in the habitable zone compared to Sun-like
stars. The estimates on the detectability of planets rely on various
instrumental characteristics but also on a prior knowledge of the
stellar spectrum. While the overall properties of M dwarf spectra have
been extensively tested against observations, the same is not true for
their detailed line profiles, which leads to significant uncertainties
when converting a given signal-to-noise ratio to a corresponding RV
precision as attainable on a given spectrograph. By combining archival
CRIRES and HARPS data with ESPaDOnS data of Barnard's star, we
show that state-of-the-art atmosphere models over-predict the Y- and

  abstract = {Context. Radial velocity monitoring of very cool dwarfs such as late M- 
and hot L-dwarfs has become a promising tool in the search for rocky
planets as well as follow-up planetary candidates around dwarfs detected
by transit surveys. These stars are faint at optical wavelengths, as
their spectral flux distribution peaks at near-infrared (NIR)
wavelengths. For this reason, it is desirable to measure the radial
velocities in this wavelength regime. However, in the NIR very few
medium- and high-resolution spectrographs are available at large
telescopes. In the near future, high-resolution spectrographs for the
NIR will be built, which will allow us to search for rocky planets
around cool M-dwarfs and L-dwarfs from radial velocities monitoring. Aims: We investigate the precision that can be attained in radial
velocity measurements of very cool dwarfs in the NIR. The goal is to
determine in which atmospheric window of the Earth's atmosphere the
highest radial velocity precision can be achieved to help in designing
the next generation of NIR high-resolution spectrographs. 
Methods: We use stellar atmosphere synthetic models for an M- and an
L-dwarf with temperatures of 2200 K and 1800 K, respectively, and a
theoretical spectrum of the Earth's transmission in the spectral range
from 0.9 to 2.5 $\mu$m. We simulate a series of Doppler-shifted spectra
observed with different resolving powers and signal-to-noise ratios, and
for different rotational broadenings of the dwarf. For different
combinations of the input parameters, we recover the radial velocity by
means of cross-correlation with a high signal-to-noise ratio template
and determine the associate uncertainties. Results: The highest
precision in radial velocity measurements for the cool M-dwarf is found
in the Y band around 1.0 $\mu$m, while for the L-dwarf it is determined
in the J band around 1.25 $\mu$m. We note that synthetic models may lack
some faint absorption features or underestimate their abundances. In
addition, some instrumental/calibration aspects that are not taken into
account in our estimations would increase the uncertainties.},

We find that NIR measurement can be as precise as optical measurements in stars of spectral type \textasciitilde{}M4, and from there the NIR gains in precision toward cooler objects. We studied potential calibration strategies in the NIR finding that a stable spectrograph with a ThAr calibration can offer enough wavelength stability for m s-1 precision. Furthermore, we simulate the
wavelength-dependent influence of activity (cool spots) on RV
measurements from optical to NIR wavelengths. Our spot simulations reveal that the RV jitter does not decrease as dramatically toward longer wavelengths as often thought. The jitter strongly depends on the details of the spots, i.e., on spot temperature and the spectral appearance of the spot. At low temperature contrast (\textasciitilde{}200 K), the jitter shows a decrease toward the NIR up to a factor of 10, but it decreases substantially less for larger temperature contrasts. Forthcoming NIR spectrographs will allow the search for planets with a particular advantage in mid- and late-M stars. Activity will remain an issue, but simultaneous observations at optical and NIR wavelengths can provide strong constraints on spot properties in active stars.},

  abstract = {The MIT-led Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has a goal of detecting terrestrial-mass planets orbiting stars bright enough for mass determination via ground-based radial velocity observations. Here we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior studies that were based on Galactic models. We model the TESS observing strategy to select approximately 200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-min cadence in full-frame image data. We place zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and use the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250+/-70 exoplanets (90\% confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 Earth-radii. Furthermore, we predict an additional 3200 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M-dwarfs, but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity
follow-up, potentially more than tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 Earth-radii with mass measurements. This sample of simulated planets is available for use in planning follow-up observations and analyses.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC$\approx$4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up
observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness
measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

installed at Paranal's VLT in order to achieve two magnitudes gain with respect to its predecessor HARPS, and the instrumental radial-velocity precision will be improved to reach 10 cm/s level. We have constituted a Consortium of astronomical research institutes to fund, design and build ESPRESSO on behalf of and in collaboration with ESO, the European Southern Observatory. The spectrograph will be installed at the Combined Coud\'e Laboratory (CCL) of the VLT, it will be linked to the four 8.2 meters Unit Telescopes through four optical "Coud\'e trains"
and will be operated either with a single telescope or with up to four UTs, enabling an additional 1.5 magnitude gain. Thanks to its
characteristics and ability of combining incoherently the light of 4 large telescopes, ESPRESSO will offer new possibilities in many fields of astronomy. Our main scientific objectives are, however, the search and characterization of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zone of quiet, near-by G to M-dwarfs, and the analysis of the variability of
fundamental physical constants. The project is, for most of its
workpackages, in the procurement or development phases, and the CCL infrastructure is presently under adaptation work. In this paper, we present the scientific objectives, the capabilities of ESPRESSO, the technical solutions for the system and its subsystems. The project aspects of this facility are also described, from the consortium and partnership structure to the planning phases and milestones.},

  abstract = {Context. Recent studies have shown that close-in brown dwarfs in the mass range 35-55 MJup are almost depleted as companions to stars, suggesting that objects with masses above and below this gap might have different formation mechanisms. Aims: We aim to test whether stars harbouring massive brown dwarfs and stars with low-mass brown dwarfs show any chemical peculiarity that could be related to different formation processes. Methods: Our methodology is based on the analysis of high-resolution \'echelle spectra (R 57 000)
from 2-3 m class telescopes. We determine the fundamental stellar parameters, as well as individual abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn for a large sample of stars known to have a substellar companion in the brown dwarf regime. The sample is divided into stars hosting massive and low-mass brown dwarfs. Following previous works, a threshold of 42.5 MJup was considered. The metallicity and abundance trends of the two subsamples are compared and set in the context of current models of planetary and brown dwarf formation. Results: Our results confirm that stars with brown dwarf companions do not follow the well-established gas-giant planet metallicity correlation seen in main-sequence planet hosts. Stars harbouring massive brown dwarfs show similar metallicity and abundance distribution as stars without known planets or with low-mass planets. We find a tendency of stars harbouring less-massive brown dwarfs of having slightly higher metallicity, [XFe/Fe] values, and abundances of Sc II, Mn I, and Ni I than the stars having the massive brown dwarfs. The data suggest, as previously reported, that massive and low-mass
brown dwarfs might present differences in period and eccentricity. Conclusions: We find evidence of a non-metallicity dependent
mechanism for the formation of massive brown dwarfs. Our results agree
with a scenario in which massive brown dwarfs are formed as stars. At
high metallicities, the core-accretion mechanism might become efficient
in the formation of low-mass brown dwarfs, while at lower metallicities
low-mass brown dwarfs could form by gravitational instability in
turbulent protostellar discs.

  abstract = {Mass and radius are two of the most fundamental properties of an astronomical object. Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these terms, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present am unbiased forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass-radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties and the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model upon a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders-of-magnitude in mass. Classification is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth), and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass-radius relation at \$2.0\_\{-0.6\}\^\{+0.7\} M\_$\backslash$oplus\$, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky Super-Earths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the Super-Earth we have been looking for.},

So far, scrambler noise dominates for bright stars, but a perfect scrambler could be built by combining adatative optics and a single-mode fiber.

synthetic telluric spectra could be used to replace the observation of
telluric standard stars, saving valuable observing time. This technique
also provides a precise in-situ wavelength calibration, especially

  abstract = {Context. Effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity are 
basic spectroscopic stellar parameters necessary to characterize a star
or a planetary system. Reliable atmospheric parameters for FGK stars
have been obtained mostly from methods that rely on high resolution and
high signal-to-noise optical spectroscopy. The advent of a new
generation of high resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectrographs opens
the possibility of using classic spectroscopic methods with high
resolution and high signal-to-noise in the NIR spectral window. 
Aims: We compile a new iron line list in the NIR from a solar spectrum
to derive precise stellar atmospheric parameters, comparable to the ones
already obtained from high resolution optical spectra. The spectral
range covers 10 000 \AA{} to 25 000 \AA{} , which is equivalent to
the Y,J,H, and K-bands. Methods: Our spectroscopic analysis is
based on the iron excitation and ionization balance done in local
thermodynamic equilibrium. We use a high resolution and high
signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the Sun from the Kitt Peak telescope
as a starting point to compile the iron line list. The oscillator
strengths (log gf) of the iron lines were calibrated for the Sun. The
abundance analysis was done using the MOOG code after measuring
equivalent widths of 357 solar iron lines. Results: We
successfully derived stellar atmospheric parameters for the Sun.
Furthermore, we analysed HD 20010, a F8IV star, from which we derived
stellar atmospheric parameters using the same line list as for the Sun.
The spectrum was obtained from the CRIRES-POP database. The results are
compatible with the values found in the literature, confirming the
reliability of our line list. However, we obtain large errors due to the
quality of the data.

  abstract = {We target the thermal emission spectrum of the non-transiting gas giant HD 88133 b with high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy, by treating the planet and its host star as a spectroscopic binary. For sufficiently deep summed flux observations of the star and planet across multiple epochs, it is possible to resolve the signal of the hot gas giant's atmosphere compared to the brighter stellar spectrum, at a level consistent with the aggregate shot noise of the full data set. To do this, we first perform a principal component analysis to remove the contribution of the Earth's atmosphere to the observed spectra. Then, we use a cross-correlation analysis to tease out the spectra of the host star and HD 88133 b to determine its orbit and identify key sources of atmospheric opacity. In total, six epochs of Keck NIRSPEC L-band observations and three epochs of Keck NIRSPEC K-band observations of the HD 88133 system were obtained. Based on an analysis of the maximum likelihood curves calculated from the multi-epoch cross-correlation of the full data set with two atmospheric models, we report the direct detection of the emission spectrum of the non-transiting exoplanet HD 88133 b and measure a radial projection of the Keplerian orbital velocity of 40 $\pm$ 15 km/s, a true mass of \{1.02\}\{MJ\}, a nearly face-on orbital inclination of \{15\}\$$\backslash$circ\$ , and an atmosphere opacity structure at high dispersion dominated by water vapor. This, combined with 11 years of radial velocity measurements of the system, provides the most up-to-date ephemeris for HD 88133.},

  abstract = {For extrasolar planets discovered using the radial velocity method, the spectral characterization of the host star leads to a mass estimate of the star and subsequently of the orbiting planet. If the orbital velocity of the planet could be determined, the masses of both star and planet could be calculated using Newton's law of gravity, just as in the case of stellar double-line eclipsing binaries. Here we report high-dispersion ground-based spectroscopy of a transit of the extrasolar planet HD209458b. We see a significant wavelength shift in absorption lines from carbon monoxide in the planet's atmosphere, which we conclude arises from a change in the radial component of the planet's orbital velocity. The masses of the star and planet are 1.00+/-0.22M\textsubscript{Sun} and 0.64+/-0.09M\textsubscript{Jup} respectively. A blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal of approximately 2kms\textsuperscript{-1} with respect to the systemic velocity of the host star suggests the presence of a strong wind flowing from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet within the 0.01-0.1mbar atmospheric pressure range probed by these observations. The strength of the carbon monoxide signal suggests a carbon monoxide mixing ratio of (1-3)\texttimes{}10\textsuperscript{-3} in this planet's upper atmosphere.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm to search for the faint spectrum of a second star mixed with the spectrum of a brighter star in high resolution spectra. We model optical stellar spectra as the sum of two input spectra drawn from a vast library of stars throughout the H-R diagram. From typical spectra having a resolution of R = 60,000, we are able to detect companions as faint as 1\% relative to the primary star in approximately the V and R bandpasses of photometry. We are also able to find evidence for triple and quadruple systems, given that any
additional companions are sufficiently bright. The precise threshold percentage depends on the signal-to-noise of the spectrum and the properties of the two stars. For cases of non-detection, we place a limit on the brightness of any potential companions. This algorithm is useful for detecting faint orbiting companions and background stars that are angularly close to a foreground target star. The size of the entrance slit to the spectrometer, 0.87 \texttimes{} 3 arcsec (typically),
sets the angular domain within which the second star can be detected. We analyzed Keck-HIRES spectra of 1160 California Kepler Survey objects of interest (KOI) searching for the secondary spectra, with the two goals of alerting the community to two possible host stars of the transiting planet and to dilution of the light curve. We report 63 California KOI showing spectroscopic evidence of a secondary star.},

  abstract = {We report the detection of water absorption features in the day side spectrum of the first-known hot Jupiter, 51 Peg b, confirming the star-planet system to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary. We use high-resolution (R$\approx$ 100,000), 3.2 $\mu$ \{\{m\}\} spectra taken with CRIRES/VLT to trace the radial-velocity shift of the water features in the planet's day side atmosphere during 4 hr of its 4.23 day orbit after superior conjunction. We detect the signature of molecular absorption by water at a significance of 5.6$\sigma$ at a systemic velocity of \{V\}\{sys\}=-33+/- 2 km/s, coincident with the 51 Peg host star, with a corresponding orbital velocity \{K\}\{P\}=\{133\} km /s. This translates directly to a planet mass of \{M\}\{p\}=\{0.476\}\{M\}\{\{J\}\}, placing it at the transition boundary between Jovian and Neptunian worlds. We determine upper and lower limits on the orbital inclination of the system of 70 -82 degrees. We also provide an updated orbital solution for 51 Peg b, using an extensive set of 639 stellar radial velocities measured between 1994 and 2013, finding no significant evidence of an eccentric orbit. We find no evidence of significant absorption or emission from other major carbon-bearing molecules of the planet, including methane and carbon dioxide. The atmosphere is non-inverted in the temperature-pressure region probed by these observations. The deepest absorption lines reach an observed relative contrast of 0.9\texttimes{} \{10\}e-3  with respect to the host star continuum flux at an angular separation of 3 milliarcseconds. This work is consistent with a previous tentative report of K-band molecular absorption for 51 Peg b by Brogi et al.},

  abstract = {Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. \\
 Aims: A summary of Gaia DR1 is presented along with illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. \\
 Methods: The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric catalogue. \\
 Results: Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of 3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1} for the proper motions. A systematic component of 0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of 94 000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1}. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is 10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to 0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. \\
 Conclusions: Gaia DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive validation shows that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

  abstract = {We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the \$G\_$\backslash$mathrm\{BP\}\$ (330--680 nm) and \$G\_$\backslash$mathrm\{RP\}\$ (630--1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.},

  abstract = {Context. Data from complex modern astronomical instruments often consist of a large number of different science and calibration files, and their reduction requires a variety of software tools. The execution chain of the tools represents a complex workflow that needs to be tuned and supervised, often by individual researchers that are not necessarily experts for any specific instrument. Aims: The efficiency of data reduction can be improved by using automatic workflows to organise data and execute a sequence of data reduction steps. To realize such
efficiency gains, we designed a system that allows intuitive
representation, execution and modification of the data reduction workflow, and has facilities for inspection and interaction with the data. Methods: The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has developed Reflex, an environment to automate data reduction workflows. Reflex is implemented as a package of customized components for the Kepler workflow engine. Kepler provides the graphical user interface to create an executable flowchart-like representation of the data reduction process. Key features of Reflex are a rule-based data organiser, infrastructure to re-use results, thorough book-keeping, data progeny tracking, interactive user interfaces, and a novel concept to exploit information created during data organisation for the workflow execution. Results: Automated workflows can greatly increase the efficiency of astronomical data reduction. In Reflex, workflows can be run
non-interactively as a first step. Subsequent optimization can then be carried out while transparently re-using all unchanged intermediate products. We found that such workflows enable the reduction of complex data by non-expert users and minimizes mistakes due to book-keeping errors. Conclusions: Reflex includes novel concepts to increase the efficiency of astronomical data processing. While Reflex is a specific implementation of astronomical scientific workflows within the Kepler workflow engine, the overall design choices and methods can also be applied to other environments for running automated science
workflows.},

transmission spectra from transiting exoplanets over a wide wavelength range in the near-infrared. Methods: By using an inverse method approach, combined with stellar models and telluric transmission spectra, the method recovers the transiting exoplanet's atmospheric transmittance at high precision over a wide wavelength range. We describe our method and have tested it by simulating observations. Results: This method is capable of recovering transmission spectra of high enough accuracy to identify absorption features from molecules such as O2, CH4, CO2, and H2O. This accuracy is achievable for Jupiter-size exoplanets at S/N that can be reached for 8 m class telescopes using high-resolution spectrometers (R$>$ 20 000) during a single transit, and for Earth-size planets and super-Earths transiting late K or M dwarf stars at S/N reachable during observations of less than 10 transits. We also analyse potential error sources to show the robustness of the method. Conclusions: Detection and characterization of atmospheres of both Jupiter-size planets and smaller rocky planets looks promising using this set-up.},

Our equation of state includes 105 molecules and up to 27 ionization stages of 39 elements. In the calculations of the base grid of model atmospheres presented here, we include over 300 molecular bands of four molecules (TiO, VO, CaH, FeH) in the JOLA approximation, the water opacity of Ludwig (1971), collision-induced opacities, b-f and f-f atomic processes, as well as about 2 million spectral lines selected from a list with more than 42 million atomic and 24 million molecular (H2, CH, NH, OH, MgH, SiH, C2, CN, CO, SiO) lines. High-resolution synthetic spectra are obtained using an opacity sampling method. The model atmospheres and spectra are calculated with the generalized stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX, assuming LTE,
plane-parallel geometry, energy (radiative plus convective)
conservation, and hydrostatic equilibrium. The model spectra give close agreement with observations of M dwarfs across a wide spectral range from the blue to the near-IR, with one notable exception: the fit to the water bands. We discuss several practical applications of our model grid, e.g., broadband colors derived from the synthetic spectra. In light of current efforts to identify genuine brown dwarfs, we also show how low-resolution spectra of cool dwarfs vary with surface gravity, and how the high-regulation line profile of the Li I resonance doublet depends on the Li abundance.},

  abstract = {Proxima b is our nearest potentially rocky exoplanet and represents a formidable opportunity for exoplanet science and possibly astrobiology. With an angular separation of only 35\textasciitilde{}mas (or 0.05\textasciitilde{}AU) from its host star, Proxima b is however hardly observable with current imaging telescopes and future space-based coronagraphs. One way to separate the photons of the planet from those of its host star is to use an interferometer that can easily resolve such spatial scales. In addition, its proximity to Earth and its favorable contrast ratio compared with its host M dwarf (approximately 10\$\^\{-5\}\$ at 10 microns) makes it an ideal target for a space-based nulling interferometer with relatively small apertures. In this paper, we present the motivation for observing this planet in the mid-infrared (5-20 microns) and the corresponding technological challenges. Then, we describe the concept of a space-based infrared interferometer with relatively small (\$$<$\$1m in diameter) apertures that can measure key details of Proxima b, such as its size, temperature, climate structure, as well as the presence of important atmospheric molecules such as H\$\_2\$O, CO\$\_2\$, O\$\_3\$, and CH\$\_4\$. Finally, we illustrate the concept by showing realistic observations using synthetic spectra of Proxima b computed with coupled climate chemistry models.},

  abstract = {Context. At young ages, low surface gravity affects the atmospheric properties of ultracool dwarfs. The impact on medium-resolution
near-infrared (NIR) spectra has only been slightly investigated at the M-L transition so far. Aims: We present a library of NIR
(1.1-2.45 $\mu$m) medium-resolution (R \textasciitilde{} 1500-2000) integral field
spectra of 15 young M6-L0 dwarfs. We aim at deriving updated NIR spectral type, luminosity, and physical parameters (Teff, log g, M, L/L$\odot$) for each source. This work also aims at
testing the latest generation of BT-SETTL atmospheric models. Methods: We estimated spectral types using spectral indices and the spectra of young objects classified in the optical. We used the 2010 and 2012 releases of the BT-SETTL synthetic spectral grid and cross-checked the results with the DRIFT-PHOENIX models to derive the atmospheric properties of the sources. Results: We do not find significant differences between the spectra of young companions and those of young isolated brown dwarfs in the same spectral type range. We derive infrared spectral types L0 $\pm$ 1, L0 $\pm$ 1, M9.5 $\pm$ 0.5,
M9.5 $\pm$ 0.5, M9.25 $\pm$ 0.25,
M8+0.5-0.75, and M8.5 $\pm$ 0.5 for AB Pic b,
Cha J110913-773444, USco CTIO 108B, GSC 08047-00232 B, DH Tau B, CT Cha b, and HR7329B, respectively. The BT-SETTL and DRIFT-PHOENIX models yield close Teff and log g estimates for each source. The models seem to show a 600+600-300 K drop in the effective temperature at the M-L transition. Assuming the former temperatures are correct, we then derive new mass estimates that confirm that DH Tau B, USco CTIO 108B, AB Pic b, KPNO Tau 4, OTS 44, and Cha1109 lie inside or at the boundary of the planetary mass range. We combine the empirical luminosities of the M9.5-L0 sources to the Teff to derive semi-empirical radii estimates that do not match "hot-start" evolutionary models predictions at 1-3 Myr. We use complementary data to demonstrate that atmospheric models are able to reproduce the combined optical and infrared spectral energy distribution, together with the NIR spectra of these sources simultaneously. But the models still fail to represent the dominant features in the optical. This issue raises doubts on the ability of these models to predict effective temperatures from NIR spectra alone. Conclusions: The library provides templates for characterizing other young and late type objects. The study
advocates the use of photometric and spectroscopic information over a broad range of wavelengths to study the properties of very low-mass young companions to be detected with the planet imagers (Subaru/SCExAO, LBT/LMIRCam, Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE).

projected rotational velocity of nine T dwarfs from the comparison of
high-resolution near-infrared spectra and synthetic models, and estimate
the mass and age of the objects from state-of-the-art models. Methods: We use the AMES-COND cloudless solar metallicity models
provided by the PHOENIX code to match the spectra of nine T-type field
dwarfs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph
NIRSPEC using ten echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.147
to 1.347 $\mu$m with a resolving power R\texttildelow{}20 000. The projected
rotational velocity, effective temperature and surface gravity of the
objects are determined based on the minimum root mean square of the
differences between the modelled and observed relative fluxes. Estimates
of the mass and age of the objects are obtained from effective
temperature-surface gravity diagrams, where our results are compared
with existing solar metallicity models. Results: The modelled
spectra reproduce quite well the observed features for most of the T
dwarfs, with effective temperatures in the range of 922-1009 K, and
surface gravities between 104.1 and 104.9 cm
s-2. Our results support the assumption of a dust free
atmosphere for T dwarfs later than T5, where dust grains form and then
gravitationally sediment into the low atmosphere. The modelled spectra
do not accurately mimic some individual very strong lines like the K i
doublet at 1.2436 and 1.2525 $\mu$m. Our modelled spectra does not match
well the observed spectra of the two T dwarfs with earlier spectral
types, namely SDSSp J125453.90-012247.4 (T2) and
2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5), which is likely due
to the presence of condensate clouds that are not incorporated in the
models used here. By comparing our results and their uncertainties to
evolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval
$\approx$5-75\textasciitilde{}MJ for T dwarfs later than T5, which are in good
agreement with those found in the literature. We found apparent young
ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few Gyr for the same T dwarfs,
which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.

  abstract = {The acronym ESPRESSO stems for Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations; this instrument will be the next VLT high resolution spectrograph. The spectrograph will be installed at the Combined-Coud\'e Laboratory of the VLT and linked to the four 8.2 m Unit Telescopes (UT) through four optical Coud\'e trains. ESPRESSO will combine efficiency and extreme spectroscopic precision. ESPRESSO is foreseen to achieve a gain of two magnitudes with respect to its predecessor HARPS, and to improve the instrumental radial-velocity precision to reach the 10 cm s\textsuperscript{-1} level. It can be operated either with a single UT or with up to four UTs, enabling an additional gain in the latter mode. The incoherent combination of four telescopes and the extreme precision requirements called for many innovative design solutions while ensuring the technical heritage of the successful HARPS experience. ESPRESSO will allow to explore new frontiers in most domains of astrophysics that require precision and sensitivity. The main scientific drivers are the search and characterization of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zone of quiet, nearby G to M-dwarfs and the analysis of the variability of fundamental physical constants. The project passed the final design review in May 2013 and entered the manufacturing phase. ESPRESSO will be installed at the Paranal Observatory in 2016 and its operation is planned to start by the end of the same year.},

  abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large (6.6 m), cold ($<$50 K), infrared (IR)-optimized space observatory that will be launched early in the next decade into orbit around the second Earth Sun Lagrange point. The observatory will have four instruments: a near-IR camera, a near-IR multiobject spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will cover the wavelength range, 0.6 $<$ ; $<$ 5.0 $\mu$ m, while the mid-IR
instrument will do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5.0 $<$ ; $<$ 29 $\mu$ m. The JWST science goals are divided into four themes. The key objective of The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization theme is to identify the first luminous sources to form and to determine the ionization history of the early universe. The key objective of The Assembly of Galaxies theme is to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars, metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from the epoch of reionization to the present day. The key objective of The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems theme is to unravel the birth and early evolution of stars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary systems. The key objective of the Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme is to determine the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own, and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. Within these themes and objectives, we have derived representative astronomical observations. To enable these observations, JWST consists of a telescope, an instrument package, a spacecraft, and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments, some of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment on-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. The instrument package contains the four science instruments and a fine guidance sensor. The spacecraft provides pointing, orbit maintenance, and communications. The sunshield provides passive thermal control. The JWST operations plan is based on that used for previous space
observatories, and the majority of JWST observing time will be allocated to the international astronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.},

To fill the useful field of 135 mm in the dispersion direction and 21 mm in the spatial direction and to maximize simultaneous spectral coverage, a mosaic solution similar to CCD mosaics has been chosen. It allows a minimum spacing between the detectors of 264 pixels.

  abstract = {Context. With about 2000 extrasolar planets confirmed, the results show 
that planetary systems have a whole range of unexpected properties. This
wide diversity provides fundamental clues to the processes of planet
formation and evolution. Aims: We present a full investigation of
the HD 219828 system, a bright metal-rich star for which a hot Neptune
has previously been detected. Methods: We used a set of HARPS,
SOPHIE, and ELODIE radial velocities to search for the existence of
orbiting companions to HD 219828. The spectra were used to characterise
the star and its chemical abundances, as well as to check for spurious,
activity induced signals. A dynamical analysis is also performed to
study the stability of the system and to constrain the orbital
parameters and planet masses. Results: We announce the discovery
of a long period (P = 13.1 yr) massive (m sini = 15.1 MJup)
companion (HD 219828 c) in a very eccentric orbit (e = 0.81). The same
data confirms the existence of a hot Neptune, HD 219828 b, with a
minimum mass of 21 M$\oplus$ and a period of 3.83 days. The
dynamical analysis shows that the system is stable, and that the
equilibrium eccentricity of planet b is close to zero. 
Conclusions: The HD 219828 system is extreme and unique in several
aspects. First, ammong all known exoplanet systems it presents an
unusually high mass ratio. We also show that systems like HD 219828,
with a hot Neptune and a long-period massive companion are more frequent
than similar systems with a hot Jupiter instead. This suggests that the
formation of hot Neptunes follows a different path than the formation of
their hot jovian counterparts. The high mass, long period, and
eccentricity of HD 219828 c also make it a good target for Gaia
astrometry as well as a potential target for atmospheric
characterisation, using direct imaging or high-resolution spectroscopy.
Astrometric observations will allow us to derive its real mass and
orbital configuration. If a transit of HD 219828 b is detected, we will
be able to fully characterise the system, including the relative orbital
inclinations. With a clearly known mass, HD 219828 c may become a
benchmark object for the range in between giant planets and brown
dwarfs.

  abstract = {Two years ago a new benchmark for the planetary survey was set with the discoveries of three extrasolar planets with masses below 20 M\_$\oplus$. In particular, the serendipitous discovery of the 14 M\_$\oplus$ planet
around $\mu$ Ara found with HARPS with a semi-amplitude of only 4 m
s-1 put in evidence the tremendous potential of HARPS for the search of this class of very low-mass planets. Aiming to discovering new worlds similar to $\mu$ Ara b, we carried out an intensive campaign with HARPS to observe a selected sample of northern stars covering a range of metallicity from about solar to twice solar. Two stars in our program were found to present radial velocity variations compatible with the presence of a planet-mass companion. The first of these, HD 219828, was found to be orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 19.8 M\_$\oplus$
and an orbital period of 3.83 days. It is the 11th Neptune-mass planet found so far orbiting a solar-type star. The radial velocity data clearly show the presence of an additional body to the system, likely of planetary mass. The second planet orbits HD 102195, has a mass of 0.45 M\_Jup and an orbital period of 4.11 days. This planet has been already announced by Ge et al. (2006, ApJ, 648, 683). Our data confirm and improve the orbital solution found by these authors. We also show that the high residuals of the orbital solution are caused by stellar activity, and use the bisectors of the HARPS cross-correlation function to correct the noise introduced by stellar activity. An improved orbital solution is obtained after this correction. This kind of analysis may be used in the future to correct the radial-velocities for stellar activity induced noise.

  abstract = {Context. The spectral signature of an exoplanet can be separated from the spectrum of its host star using high-resolution spectroscopy. During these observations, the radial component of the planet's orbital velocity changes, resulting in a significant Doppler shift that allows its spectral features to be extracted. \\
 Aims: In this work, we aim to detect TiO in the optical transmission spectrum of HD 209458b. Gaseous TiO has been suggested as the cause of the thermal inversion layer invoked to explain the dayside spectrum of this planet. \\
 Methods: We used archival data from the 8.2 m Subaru telescope taken with the High Dispersion Spectrograph of a transit of HD 209458b in 2002. We created model transmission spectra that include absorption by TiO, and cross-correlated them with the residual spectral data after removal of the dominating stellar absorption features. We subsequently co-added the correlation signal in time, taking the change in Doppler shift due to the orbit of the planet into account. \\
 Results: We detect no significant cross-correlation signal due to TiO, though artificial injection of our template spectra into the data indicates a sensitivity down to a volume-mixing ratio of \textasciitilde{}10\textsuperscript{-10}. However, cross-correlating the template spectra with a HARPS spectrum of Barnard's star yields only a weak wavelength-dependent correlation, even though Barnard's star is an M4V dwarf that exhibits clear TiO absorption. We infer that the TiO line list poorly matches the real positions of TiO lines at spectral resolutions of \textasciitilde{}100 000. Similar line lists are also used in the PHOENIX and Kurucz stellar atmosphere suites and we show that their synthetic M-dwarf spectra also correlate poorly with the HARPS spectra of Barnard's star and five other M dwarfs. We conclude that the lack of an accurate TiO line list is currently critically hampering this high-resolution retrieval technique.},

  abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body
accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone.

All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase.

The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Zmasses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density ($\sigma$init) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that
$\sigma$init$\approx$ 10 g cm-2near Jupiter's orbit and
that $\sigma$init$\propto$a-2, whereais the distance
from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the "minimum-mass" solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These
estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems.},

semiamplitude of 77 m s-1 and a period of 14.65 days, implying a semimajor axis of 0.11 AU and a minimum mass for the
companion of M2 sin i = 0.84MJUP. For HR 5185, the semiamplitude is 469 m s-1, and the period is 3.3128 days, implying an orbital radius of 0.0462 AU and a minimum mass of
3.87MJUP. For HR 458, the semiamplitude is 74 m
s-1, and the period is 4.61 days, implying an orbital radius of 0.057 AU and a minimum mass of 0.68MJUP. These three companions, along with 51 Peg b, may constitute a heretofore
unrecognized class of planets, defined by circular orbits, Jupiter-like masses, and orbital radii less than \textasciitilde{}0.2 AU. The relatively large orbital radius for HR 3522 (0.11 AU) precludes tidal circularization, suggesting that the circular orbits are primordial. During the past 9 years, the velocity residuals to the Keplerian fit of HR 3522 exhibit a long-term systematic trend, suggestive of an additional companion. HR 5185 exhibits velocity residuals that fluctuate erratically by \textasciitilde{}70 m s-1, which are as yet unaccounted for. HR 5185 has a rotation period very close to the orbital period of the planet, suggesting that the companion may have tidally locked the primary.

The minimum mass of the unseen companion is M2 sin i = 2.39 MJ, and for likely orbital inclinations of 30 deg--90 deg, its mass is less than 4.8 MJ. This mass resides in a regime associated with extrasolar giant planets (Burrows and coworkers). Unlike the planet candidates 70 Vir B and 51 Peg B, this companion has an orbital radius (2.1 AU) and
eccentricity (e = 0.03) reminiscent of giant planets in our solar system. Its effective temperature will be at least 180 K due simply to absorbed stellar radiation, and probably slightly higher due to
intrinsic heating from gravitational contraction (Guillot and
coworkers). For 47 UMa B to be, instead, an orbiting brown dwarf of mass M $>$ 40 MJ, the inclination would have to be i $<$ 3.dg4, which
occurs for only 0.18\% of randomly oriented orbits. In any case, this companion is separated from the primary star by \textasciitilde{}0."2, which portends follow-up work by astrometric and direct IR techniques.},

  abstract = {Context. Atmospheric properties of exoplanets can be constrained with 
transit spectroscopy. At low spectral resolution, this technique is
limited by the presence of clouds. The signature of atomic sodium (Na
i), known to be present above the clouds, is a powerful probe of the
upper atmosphere, where it can be best detected and characterized at
high spectral resolution. Aims: Our goal is to obtain a
high-resolution transit spectrum of HD 189733b in the region around the
resonance doublet of Na i at 589 nm, to characterize the absorption
signature that was previously detected from space at low resolution. Methods: We analyzed archival transit data of HD 189733b obtained
with the HARPS spectrograph ($\mathscr{R}$ = 115 000) at the ESO 3.6-m
telescope. We performed differential spectroscopy to retrieve the
transit spectrum and light curve of the planet, implementing corrections
for telluric contamination and planetary orbital motion. We compared our
results to synthetic transit spectra calculated from isothermal models
of the planetary atmosphere. Results: We spectrally resolve the
Na i D doublet and measure line contrasts of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.07\% (D2)
and 0.40 $\pm$ 0.07\% (D1) and FWHMs of 0.52 $\pm$ 0.08 \AA.
This corresponds to a detection at the 10$\sigma$ level of excess of
absorption of 0.32 $\pm$ 0.03\% in a passband of 2 \texttimes{} 0.75
\AA{} centered on each line. We derive temperatures of 2600 $\pm$
600 K and 3270 $\pm$ 330 K at altitudes of 9800 $\pm$ 2800 and 12
700 $\pm$ 2600 km in the Na i D1 and D2 line cores, respectively. We
measure a temperature gradient of \textasciitilde{}0.2 K km-1 in the region
where the sodium absorption dominates the haze absorption from a
comparison with theoretical models. We also detect a blueshift of 0.16
$\pm$ 0.04 \AA{} (4$\sigma$) in the line positions. This blueshift
may be the result of winds blowing at 8 $\pm$ 2 km s-1 in
the upper layers of the atmosphere. Conclusions: We demonstrate
the relevance of studying exoplanet atmospheres with high-resolution
spectrographs mounted on 4-m-class telescopes. Our results pave the way
for an in-depth characterization of physical conditions in the
atmospheres of many exoplanetary systems with future spectrographs such
as ESPRESSO on the VLT or HiReS and METIS on the E-ELT.

The wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the the temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere. Anomalies in the timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of additional planets or moons. Searching for eclipses is also a productive means of discovering new planets.

A temperate planet has been discovered orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest M dwarf, but it probably does not transit and its true mass is unknown. Seven
Earth-sized planets transit the very low-mass star TRAPPIST-1, which is 12 parsecs away, but their masses and, particularly, their densities are poorly constrained. Here we report observations of LHS 1140b, a planet with a radius of 1.4 Earth radii transiting a small, cool star (LHS 1140) 12 parsecs away. We measure the mass of the planet to be 6.6 times that of Earth, consistent with a rocky bulk composition. LHS 1140b receives an insolation of 0.46 times that of Earth, placing it within the liquid-water, habitable zone. With 90 per cent confidence, we place an upper limit on the orbital eccentricity of 0.29. The circular orbit is unlikely to be the result of tides and therefore was probably present at formation. Given its large surface gravity and cool insolation, the planet may have retained its atmosphere despite the greater luminosity (compared to the present-day) of its host star in its youth. Because LHS 1140 is nearby, telescopes currently under construction might be able to search for specific atmospheric gases in the future.},

  abstract = {The angle between the spin axis of the host star and the orbit of its planets (i.e., the stellar obliquity) is precious information about the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. Measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect revealed that many stars that host a hot-Jupiter have high obliquities, suggesting that hot-Jupiter formation involves excitation of orbital inclinations. In this contribution we show how the passage of the planet over starspots can be used to measure the obliquity of exoplanetary systems. This technique is used to obtain - for the first time - the obliquity of a system with several planets that lie in a disk, Kepler-30, with the result that the star has an obliquity smaller than 10 degrees. The implications for the formation of exoplanetary systems, in particular the hot-Jupiter population, are also discussed.},

At the time of this data release, 705 stars from this first data set have exoplanet candidates with sizes from as small as that of Earth to larger than that of Jupiter. Here we give the identity and characteristics of 305 released stars with planetary candidates. Data for the remaining 400 stars with planetary candidates will be released in 2011 February. More than half the candidates on the released list have radii less than half that of Jupiter. Five candidates are present in and near the habitable zone; two near super-Earth size, and three bracketing the size of Jupiter. The released stars also include five possible multi-planet systems. One of these has two Neptune-size (2.3 and 2.5 Earth radius) candidates with near-resonant periods.},

Binary stars provide the primary source of false positives among Kepler planet candidates, implying that false positives should be nearly randomly distributed among Kepler targets. In contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around a smaller number of Kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systems and/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star are correlated. There are more than one hundred times as many Kepler planet candidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a random distribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets. Most of these multis are multiple-planet systems orbiting the Kepler target star, but there are likely cases where (1) the planetary system orbits a fainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has been estimated, or (2) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiple star system. We use the low overall false-positive rate among Kepler multis, together with analysis of Kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validate the closely packed Kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that has evolved somewhat off of the main sequence. Kepler-33 hosts five transiting planets, with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.},

a key value for statistical studies of candidate properties. A previous
investigation of the stellar population in the Kepler field has provided
an estimate for the FPP of less than 5\% for most of the candidates. We
report here the results of our radial velocity observations on a sample
of 46 Kepler candidates with a transit depth greater than 0.4\%, orbital
period less than 25 days and host star brighter than Kepler magnitude
14.7. We used the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at
the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to establish the nature of the
transiting candidates. In this sample, we found five undiluted eclipsing
binaries, two brown dwarfs, six diluted eclipsing binaries, and nine new
transiting planets that complement the 11 already published planets. The
remaining 13 candidates were not followed-up or remain unsolved due to
photon noise limitation or lack of observations. From these results we
computed the FPP for Kepler close-in giant candidates to be 34.8\%
$\pm$ 6.5\%. We aimed to investigate the variation of the FPP for
giant candidates with the longer orbital periods and found that it
should be constant for orbital periods between 10 and 200 days. This
significantly disagrees with the previous estimates. We discuss the
reasons for this discrepancy and the possible extension of this work
toward smaller planet candidates. Finally, taking the false-positive
rate into account, we refined the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters from
the Kepler data.

  abstract = {We report on an intensive observational campaign carried out with HARPS at the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla on the star CoRoT-7. Additional simultaneous photometric measurements carried out with the Euler Swiss telescope have demonstrated that the observed radial velocity variations are dominated by rotational modulation from cool spots on the stellar surface. Several approaches were used to extract the radial velocity signal of the planet(s) from the stellar activity signal. First, a simple pre-whitening procedure was employed to find and subsequently remove periodic signals from the complex frequency structure of the radial velocity data. The dominant frequency in the power spectrum was found at 23 days, which corresponds to the rotation period of CoRoT-7. The 0.8535 day period of CoRoT-7b planetary candidate was detected with an amplitude of 3.3 m s\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{. Most other frequencies, some with amplitudes larger than the CoRoT-7b signal, are most likely associated with activity. A second approach used harmonic decomposition of the rotational period and up to the first three harmonics to filter out the activity signal from radial velocity variations caused by orbiting planets. After correcting the radial velocity data for activity, two periodic signals are detected: the CoRoT-7b transit period and a second one with a period of 3.69 days and an amplitude of 4 m s\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{. This second signal was also found in the pre-whitening analysis. We attribute the second signal to a second, more remote planet CoRoT-7c . The orbital solution of both planets is compatible with circular orbits. The mass of CoRoT-7b is () and that of CoRoT-7c is (), assuming both planets are on coplanar orbits. We also investigated the false positive scenario of a blend by a faint stellar binary, and this may be rejected by the stability of the bisector on a nightly scale. According to their masses both planets belong to the super-Earth planet category. The average density of CoRoT-7b is , similar to the Earth. The CoRoT-7 planetary system provides us with the first insight into the physical nature of short period super-Earth planets recently detected by radial velocity surveys. These planets may be denser than Neptune and therefore likely made of rocks like the Earth, or a mix of water ice and rocks.}}}}},

significant TTVs with long-term variations ($>$100 days), and another
14 KOIs with periodic modulations shorter than 100 days and small

curves revealed transits of a planetary companion, Kepler-21b, with a radius of about 1.60 $\pm$ 0.04 \{R\}$\backslash$oplus and an orbital period of about 2.7857 days. However, they could not determine the mass of the planet from the initial radial velocity (RV) observations with Keck-HIRES, and were only able to impose a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of 10
\{M\}$\backslash$oplus . Here, we present results from the analysis of 82 new RV observations of this system obtained with HARPS-N, together with the existing 14 HIRES data points. We detect the Doppler signal of Kepler-21b with a RV semiamplitude K = 2.00 $\pm$ 0.65 \{\{m\}\}
\{\{\{s\}\}\}-1, which corresponds to a planetary mass of 5.1 $\pm$ 1.7 \{M\}$\backslash$oplus . We also measure an improved radius
for the planet of 1.639 +0.019/-0.015 \{R\}$\backslash$oplus , in
agreement with the radius reported by Howell et al. We conclude that Kepler-21b, with a density of 6.4 $\pm$ 2.1 \{\{g\}\}
\{\{cm\}\}-3, belongs to the population of small, $\lessequivlnt$6
\{M\}$\backslash$oplus planets with iron and magnesium silicate
interiors, which have lost the majority of their envelope volatiles via stellar winds or gravitational escape. The RV analysis presented in this paper serves as an example of the type of analysis that will be
necessary to confirm the masses of TESS small planet candidates.

39 minutes per orbit; in addition, the transit times of the inner body
display an alternating variation of smaller amplitude. These signatures
are characteristic of gravitational interaction of two planets near a
2:1 orbital resonance. Six radial-velocity observations show that these
two planets are the most massive objects orbiting close to the star and
substantially improve the estimates of their masses. After removing the
signal of the two confirmed giant planets, we identified an additional
transiting super-Earth-size planet candidate with a period of 1.6 days.},

For many of these newly discovered planets, the intervals between successive transits will be measured with an accuracy of 0.1 to 100 minutes. We show that these timing measurements will allow for the detection of additional planets in the system (not necessarily
transiting) by their gravitational interaction with the transiting planet. The transit-time variations depend on the mass of the additional planet, and in some cases terrestrial-mass planets will produce a measurable effect. In systems where two planets are seen to transit, the density of both planets can be determined without radial-velocity observations.},

  abstract = {A large fraction of the smallest transiting planet candidates discovered 
by the Kepler and CoRoT space missions cannot be confirmed by a
dynamical measurement of the mass using currently available observing
facilities. To establish their planetary nature, the concept of planet
validation has been advanced. This technique compares the probability of
the planetary hypothesis against that of all reasonably conceivable
alternative false positive (FP) hypotheses. The candidate is considered
as validated if the posterior probability of the planetary hypothesis is
sufficiently larger than the sum of the probabilities of all FP
scenarios. In this paper, we present PASTIS, the Planet Analysis and
Small Transit Investigation Software, a tool designed to perform a
rigorous model comparison of the hypotheses involved in the problem of
planet validation, and to fully exploit the information available in the
candidate light curves. PASTIS self-consistently models the transit
light curves and follow-up observations. Its object-oriented structure
offers a large flexibility for defining the scenarios to be compared.
The performance is explored using artificial transit light curves of
planets and FPs with a realistic error distribution obtained from a
Kepler light curve. We find that data support the correct hypothesis
strongly only when the signal is high enough (transit signal-to-noise
ratio above 50 for the planet case) and remain inconclusive otherwise.
PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) shall provide
transits with high enough signal-to-noise ratio, but to establish the
true nature of the vast majority of Kepler and CoRoT transit candidates
additional data or strong reliance on hypotheses priors is needed.},

It involves eclipsing binaries and giant planets that present only a secondary eclipse, as seen from the Earth. To test how an eclipsing binary configuration can mimic a planetary transit, we generated synthetic light curves of three examples of secondary-only eclipsing binary systems that we fit with a circular planetary model. Then, to evaluate its occurrence we modeled a population of binaries in double and triple systems based on binary statistics and occurrence. We find that 0.061\% $\pm$ 0.017\% of main-sequence binary stars are secondary-only eclipsing binaries that mimics a planetary transit candidate with a size down to the size of the Earth. We then evaluate the occurrence that an occulting-only giant planet can mimic an Earth-like planet or even a smaller one. We find that 0.009\% $\pm$ 0.002\% of stars harbor a giant planet that only presents the secondary transit. Occulting-only giant planets mimic planets that are smaller than the Earth, and they are in the scope of space missions like \emph{Kepler \emph{and PLATO.

third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment - OGLE-III.
Photometric observations of three fields in the direction of the
Galactic center (800 epochs per field) were collected on 32 nights
during time interval of 45 days. Out of the total of 5 million stars
monitored, about 52000 Galactic disk stars with photometry better than
1.5\% were analyzed for flat-bottomed eclipses with the depth smaller
than 0.08 mag. Altogether 46 stars with transiting low-luminosity
objects were detected. For 42 of them multiple transits were observed, a
total of 185, allowing orbital period determination. Transits in two
objects: OGLE-TR-40 and OGLE-TR-10, with the radii ratio of about 0.14
and estimate of the radius of the companion 1.0-1.5R\_Jup, resemble the
well known planetary transit in HD 209458. The sample was selected by
the presence of apparent transits only, with no knowledge on any other
properties. Hence, it is very well suited for general study of
low-luminosity objects. The transiting objects may be Jupiters, brown
dwarfs, or M dwarfs. Future determination of the amplitude of radial
velocity changes will establish their masses, and will confirm or refute
the reality of the so called ‘‘brown dwarf desert''. The low-mass
stellar companions will provide new data needed for the poorly known
mass-radius relation for the lower main sequence. All photometric data
are available to the astronomical community from the OGLE Internet

Using TESS time-series photometry, combined with GAIA data, published UCLES@AAT Doppler measurements, and archival HARPS@ESO-3.6m radial velocities, we find that Pi Men c is an inner planet with an orbital period of Porb=6.25 days, a mass of Mp = 4.51 +/- 0.81 MEarth, and a radius of Rp = 1.828+/-0.053 REarth. Based on the planet's orbital period and size, Pi Men c is a super-Earth located at, or close to, the radius gap, while its mass and bulk density suggest it may have held on to a significant atmosphere. Because of the brightness of the host star, this system is highly suitable for a wide range of further studies to characterize the planetary atmosphere and dynamical properties. We also performed a seismic analysis of the TESS light curve and found a hint of an excess power at \textasciitilde{}2600 micron-Hz with individual peaks spaced by \textasciitilde{}120 micron-Hz. Though the signal-to-noise ratio is very low, this is consistent with the predicted frequency of oscillations for a star of this type, hinting at the asteroseismic potential of the TESS mission.},

explored. We predict that in the primary mission, TESS will discover
about 3500 planets with Neptune size and smaller, half of which will
orbit stars with TESS magnitudes brighter than 12. Specifically, we
proposed a new extended mission scenario that centers Camera 3 on the

Using the 305-m Arecibo radiotelescope to make precise timing measurements of pulses from the recently discovered 6.2-ms pulsar PSR1257 +12 (ref. 2), we demonstrate that, rather than being associated with a stellar object, the pulsar is orbited by two or more planet-sized bodies. The planets detected so far have masses of at least 2.8 M$\oplus$ and 3.4 M$\oplus$ where M$\oplus$ is the mass of the Earth. Their respective distances from the pulsar are 0.47 AU and 0.36 AU, and they move in almost circular orbits with periods of 98.2 and 66.6 days. Observations indicate that at least one more planet may be present in this system. The detection of a planetary system around a nearby ($\sim$500 pc), old neutron star, together with the recent report on a planetary companion to the pulsar PSR1829\textendash{}10 (ref. 3) raises the tantalizing possibility that a non-negligible fraction of neutron stars observable as radio pulsars may be orbited by planet-like bodies.},

  abstract = {In the favoured core-accretion model of formation of planetary systems, 
solid planetesimals accumulate to build up planetary cores, which then
accrete nebular gas if they are sufficiently massive. Around M-dwarf
stars (the most common stars in our Galaxy), this model favours the
formation of Earth-mass (M$\oplus$) to Neptune-mass planets
with orbital radii of 1 to 10astronomical units (AU), which is
consistent with the small number of gas giant planets known to orbit
M-dwarf host stars. More than 170 extrasolar planets have been
discovered with a wide range of masses and orbital periods, but planets
of Neptune's mass or less have not hitherto been detected at separations
of more than 0.15AU from normal stars. Here we report the discovery of a
5.5+5.5-2.7 M$\oplus$ planetary companion at a separation of
2.6+1.5-0.6AU from a 0.22+0.21-0.11 Msolar M-dwarf star,
where Msolar refers to a solar mass. (We propose to name it
OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, indicating a planetary mass companion to the lens
star of the microlensing event.) The mass is lower than that of GJ876d
(ref. 5), although the error bars overlap. Our detection suggests that
such cool, sub-Neptune-mass planets may be more common than gas giant
planets, as predicted by the core accretion theory.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11077},
  abstract = {Context. Astrometric gravitational microlensing is an excellent tool to determine the mass of stellar objects. Using precise astrometric measurements of the lensed position of a background source in combination with accurate predictions of the positions of lens and unlensed source it is possible to determine the mass of the lens with an accuracy of a few percent. Aims. Making use of the recently published Gaia DR2 catalogue we want to predict astrometric microlensing events by foreground stars with high proper motion passing a background source in the next decades. Methods .We select roughly 148 000 high-proper-motion stars from Gaia DR2 with mu\_tot $>$150mas/yr as potential lenses. We then search for background sources close to their paths. Using the astrometric parameters of Gaia DR2 we calculate the future positions of source and lens. With a nested-intervals algorithm we determine the date and separation of the closest approach. Using Gaia DR2 photometry we determine an approximate mass of the lens, which we use to calculate the expected microlensing effects. Results. We predict 3914 microlensing events by 2875 different lenses between 2010 and 2065 with expected shifts larger than 0.1 mas between the lensed and unlensed positions of the source. 513 of those are expected to happen between 2014.5 - 2026.5 and might be measured by Gaia. For 127 events we also expect a magnification between 1 mmag and 3 mag.},

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.

  abstract = {The microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0417 is an exceptionally bright lens binary that was predicted to present radial velocity variation at the level of several km s\textsuperscript{-1}. Pioneer radial velocity follow-up observations with the UVES spectrograph at the ESO-VLT of this system clearly ruled out the large radial velocity variation, leaving a discrepancy between the observation and the prediction. In this paper, we further characterise the microlensing system by analysing its spectral energy distribution (SED) derived using the UVES spectrum and new observations with the ARCoIRIS (CTIO) near-infrared spectrograph and the Keck adaptive optics instrument NIRC2 in the J, H, and Ks-bands. We determine the mass and distance of the stars independently from the microlensing modelling. We find that the SED is compatible with a giant star in the Galactic bulge and a foreground star with a mass of 0.94 $\pm$ 0.09 M\textsubscript{$\Sun$} at a distance of 1.07 $\pm$ 0.24 kpc. We find that this foreground star is likely the lens. Its parameters are not compatible with the ones previously reported in the literature (0.52 $\pm$ 0.04 M\textsubscript{$\Sun$} at 0.95 $\pm$ 0.06 kpc), based on the microlensing light curve. A thoughtful re-analysis of the microlensing event is mandatory to fully understand the reason of this new discrepancy. More importantly, this paper demonstrates that spectroscopic follow-up observations of microlensing events are possible and provide independent constraints on the parameters of the lens and source stars, hence breaking some degeneracies in the analysis. UV-to-NIR low-resolution spectrographs like X-shooter (ESO-VLT) could substantially contribute to this follow-up efforts, with magnitude limits above all microlensing events detected so far.

  abstract = {We provide a revised assessment of the number of exoplanets that should be discovered by Gaia astrometry, extending previous studies to a broader range of spectral types, distances, and magnitudes. Our assessment is based on a large representative sample of host stars from the TRILEGAL Galaxy population synthesis model, recent estimates of the exoplanet frequency distributions as a function of stellar type, and detailed simulation of the Gaia observations using the updated instrument performance and scanning law. We use two approaches to estimate detectable planetary systems: one based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the astrometric signature per field crossing, easily reproducible and allowing comparisons with previous estimates, and a new and more robust metric based on orbit fitting to the simulated satellite data. With some plausible assumptions on planet occurrences, we find that some 21,000 ($\pm$6000) high-mass ( 1-15 M J ) long-period planets should be discovered out to distances of 500 pc for the nominal 5 yr mission (including at least 1000-1500 around M dwarfs out to 100 pc), rising to some 70,000 ($\pm$20, 000) for a 10 yr mission. We indicate some of the expected features of this exoplanet population, amongst them 25-50 intermediate-period ( P 2-3 yr) transiting systems.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a bright, brown dwarf companion to the star HIP 64892, imaged with VLT/SPHERE during the SHINE exoplanet survey. The host is a B9.5V member of the Lower-Centaurus-Crux subgroup of the Scorpius Centaurus OB association. The measured angular separation of the companion (1.2705 $\pm$ 0.0023") corresponds to a projected distance of 159 $\pm$ 12 AU. We observed the target with the dual-band imaging and long-slit spectroscopy modes of the IRDIS imager to obtain its spectral energy distribution (SED) and astrometry. In addition, we reprocessed archival NACO L-band data, from which we also recover the companion. Its SED is consistent with a young (\&lt;30 Myr), low surface gravity object with a spectral type of M9\textsubscript{$\gamma$} $\pm$ 1. From comparison with the BT-Settl atmospheric models we estimate an effective temperature of T\textsubscript{eff} = 2600 $\pm$ 100 K, and comparison of the companion photometry to the COND evolutionary models yields a mass of 29-37 M\textsubscript{J} at the estimated age of 16\textsubscript{-7}\textsuperscript{+15} Myr for the system. The star HIP 64892 is a rare example of an extreme-mass ratio system (q 0.01) and will be useful for testing models relating to the formation and evolution of such low-mass objects.

  abstract = {The discovery of the first extra-solar planet surrounding a main-sequence star was announced in 1995, based on very precise radial velocity (Doppler) measurements. A total of 34 such planets were known by the end of March 2000, and their numbers are growing steadily. The newly discovered systems confirm some of the features predicted by standard theories of star and planet formation, but systems with massive planets, having very small orbital radii and large eccentricities, are common and were generally unexpected. Other techniques being used to search for planetary signatures include accurate measurement of positional (astrometric) displacements, gravitational microlensing and pulsar timing, the latter resulting in the detection of the first planetary mass bodies beyond our solar system in 1992. The transit of a planet across the face of the host star provides significant physical diagnostics, and the first such detection was announced in 1999. Protoplanetary disks, which represent an important evolutionary stage for understanding planet formation, are being imaged from space. In contrast, direct imaging of extra-solar planets represents an enormous challenge. Long-term efforts are directed towards infrared space interferometry, the detection of Earth-mass planets, and measurement of their spectral characteristics. Theoretical atmospheric models provide predictions of planetary temperatures, radii, albedos, chemical condensates and spectral features as a function of mass, composition and distance from the host star. Efforts to characterize planets occupying the ‘habitable zone', in which liquid water may be present, and indicators of the presence of life are advancing quantitatively.},

This motion is separated into the proper motion of the barycentre and the revolution of the photocentre around the barycentre. The latter is believed to be induced by fainter

imaging1-4 provide a unique opportunity to study the
formation and early evolution of gas giant planets. A key question is to
what extent gravitational energy from accreted gas contributes to the
internal energy of a newly formed planet. This has led to a range of
formation scenarios from ‘cold' to ‘hot' start models5-8. For
a planet of a given mass, these initial conditions govern its subsequent
evolution in luminosity and radius. Except for upper limits from radial
velocity studies9,10, disk modelling11 and
dynamical instability arguments12, no mass measurements of
young planets are yet available to distinguish between these different
models. Here, we report on the detection of the astrometric motion of
Beta Pictoris, the 21-Myr-old host star of an archetypical directly
imaged gas giant planet, around the system's centre of mass. Subtracting
the highly accurate Hipparcos13,14 and Gaia15,16
proper motion from the internal 3 yr Hipparcos astrometric data reveals
the reflex motion of the star, giving a model-independent planet mass of
11 $\pm$ 2 Jupiter masses. This is consistent with scenarios in which
the planet is formed in a high-entropy state as assumed by hot start
models. The ongoing data collection by Gaia will soon lead to mass
measurements of other young gas giants and form a great asset to further
constrain early-evolution scenarios.},

  abstract = {While giant extrasolar planets have been studied for more than two 
decades now, there are still some open questions as to their dominant
formation and migration processes, as well as to their atmospheric
evolution in different stellar environments. In this paper, we study a
sample of giant transiting exoplanets detected by the Kepler telescope
with orbital periods up to 400 days. We first defined a sample of 129
giant-planet candidates that we followed up with the SOPHIE spectrograph
(OHP, France) in a 6-year radial velocity campaign. This allowed us to
unveil the nature of these candidates and to measure a false-positive
rate of 54.6 $\pm$ 6.5\% for giant-planet candidates orbiting within
400 days of period. Based on a sample of confirmed or likely planets, we
then derived the occurrence rates of giant planets in different ranges
of orbital periods. The overall occurrence rate of giant planets within
400 days is 4.6 $\pm$ 0.6\%. We recovered, for the first time in the
Kepler data, the different populations of giant planets reported by
radial velocity surveys. Comparing these rates with other yields, we
find that the occurrence rate of giant planets is lower only for hot
Jupiters but not for the longer-period planets. We also derive a first
measurement of the occurrence rate of brown dwarfs in the brown-dwarf
desert with a value of 0.29 $\pm$ 0.17\%. Finally, we discuss the
physical properties of the giant planets in our sample. We confirm that
giant planets receiving moderate irradiation are not inflated, but we
find that they are on average smaller than predicted by formation and
evolution models. In this regime of low-irradiated giant planets, we
find a possible correlation between their bulk density and the iron
abundance of the host star, which needs more detections to be confirmed.

  abstract = {We present an analysis of 11 yr of precision radial velocity measurements of 76 nearby solar-type stars from the Lick radial velocity survey. For each star, we report on variability, periodicity, and long-term velocity trends. Our sample of stars contains eight known companions with mass (Mpsini) less than 8 Jupiter masses (MJ), six of which were discovered at Lick. For the remaining stars, we place upper limits on the companion mass as a function of orbital period. For most stars, we can exclude companions with velocity amplitude K$>$\textasciitilde{}20 m s-1 at the 99\% level, or
Mpsini$>$\textasciitilde{}0.7MJ(a/AU)1/2 for orbital radii a$<$\textasciitilde{}5 AU. We examine the implications of our results for the observed distribution of mass and orbital radius of companions. We show that the combination of intrinsic stellar variability and measurement errors most likely explains why all confirmed companions so far have K$>$\textasciitilde{}40 m s-1. The finite duration of the observations
limits detection of Jupiter-mass companions to a$<$\textasciitilde{}3 AU. Thus it
remains possible that the majority of solar-type stars harbor
Jupiter-mass companions much like our own, and if so these companions should be detectable in a few years. It is striking that more massive companions with Mpsini$>$3MJ are rare at orbital radii 4-6 AU; we could have detected such objects in \textasciitilde{}90\% of stars, yet found none. The observed companions show a ‘‘piling-up'' toward small orbital radii, and there is a paucity of confirmed and candidate companions with orbital radii between \textasciitilde{}0.2 and \textasciitilde{}1 AU. The small number of confirmed companions means that we are not able to rule out selection effects as the cause of these features. We show that the traditional method for detecting periodicities, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, fails to account for statistical fluctuations in the mean of a sampled sinusoid, making it nonrobust when the number of observations is small, the sampling is uneven, or for periods comparable to or greater than the duration of the observations. We adopt a ‘‘floating-mean'' periodogram, in which the zero point of the sinusoid is allowed to vary during the fit. We discuss in detail the normalization of the periodogram and the probability distribution of periodogram powers. We stress that the three different prescriptions in the literature for normalizing the
periodogram are statistically equivalent and that it is not possible to write a simple analytic form for the false alarm probability, making Monte Carlo methods essential.},

CoRoT, steadily monitors about 12 000 stars in each of its fields of
view. Transit candidates can be detected early in the processing of the
data and before the end of a run of observation. Aims: We report
the detection of the first planet discovered by CoRoT and characterizing
it with the help of follow-up observations. Methods: Raw data
were filtered from outliers and residuals at the orbital period of the
satellite. The orbital parameters and the radius of the planet were
estimated by best fitting the phase folded light curve with 34
successive transits. Doppler measurements with the SOPHIE spectrograph
permitted us to secure the detection against binaries and to estimate
the mass of the planet. Results: The accuracy of the data is very
high with a dispersion in the 2.17 min binned phase-folded light curve
that does not exceed \textasciitilde{}3.\texttimes{}10-4 in flux unit. The planet
orbits a mildly metal-poor G0V star of magnitude V=13.6 in 1.5 days. The
estimated mass and radius of the star are 0.95$\pm$0.15
M$\odot$ and 1.11$\pm$0.05 R$\odot$. We find the
planet has a radius of 1.49$\pm$0.08 R\_Jup, a mass of
1.03$\pm$0.12 M\_Jup, and a particularly low mean density of
0.38$\pm$0.05 g cm-3.

From the modelling of the microlensing light curve, we derived basic parameters such as, the binary lens separation in Einstein radius units (s $\simeq$ 1.13), the mass ratio q = (4.732 $\pm$ 0.020) \texttimes{}
10-2 and the Einstein radius crossing time (tE $\simeq$ 82 d). Because of this long time scale, we took annual parallax and orbital motion of the lens in the models into account, as well as finite source effects that were clearly detected during the source caustic exit. To recover the lens system's physical parameters, we combined the resulting light curve best-fit parameters with
(J,H,Ks) magnitudes obtained with VLT NaCo and calibrated using IRSF and 2MASS data. From this analysis, we derived a lens total mass of 0.86 $\pm$ 0.04 M$\odot$ and a lens distance of
DL = 4.2 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc. We find that the companion of
MOA-2007-BLG-197L is a brown dwarf of 41 $\pm$ 2 MJ
observed at a projected separation of a$\perp$ = 4.3 $\pm$
0.1 AU, and orbits a 0.82 $\pm$ 0.04 M$\odot$ G-K dwarf
star. We then placed the companion of MOA-2007-BLG-197L in a mass-period diagram consisting of all brown dwarf companions detected so far through different techniques, including microlensing, transit, radial velocity, and direct imaging (most of these objects orbit solar-type stars). To study the statistical properties of this population, we performed a two-dimensional, non-parametric probability density distribution fit to the data, which draws a structured brown dwarf landscape. We confirm the existence of a region that is strongly depleted in objects at short periods and intermediate masses (P $\lessequivlnt$ 30 d, M \textasciitilde{} 30-60
MJ), but also find an accumulation of objects around P \textasciitilde{} 500 d and M \textasciitilde{} 20 MJ, as well as another depletion region at long orbital periods (P $\greaterequivlnt$ 500 d) and high masses (M $\greaterequivlnt$ 50
MJ). While these data provide important clues on the
different physical mechanisms of formation (or destruction) that shape the brown dwarf desert, more data are needed to establish their relative importance, in particular as a function of host star mass. Future microlensing surveys should soon provide more detections, in particular for red dwarf hosts, thus uniquely complementing the solar-type host sample.

  abstract = {Context. Microlensing is a unique method to probe low mass exoplanets beyond the snow line. However, the scientific potential of the new microlensing planet discovery is often unfulfilled due to lack of knowledge of the properties of the lens and source stars. The discovery light curve of the super Earth MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb suffers from
significant degeneracies that limit what can be inferred about its physical properties. Aims: High resolution adaptive optics images allow us to solve this problem by resolving the microlensing target from all unrelated background stars, yielding the unique determination of magnified source and lens fluxes. This estimation permits the solution of our microlens model for the mass of the planet and its host and their physical projected separation. Methods: We observed the
microlensing event MOA-2007-BLG-192 at high angular resolution in JHKs with the NACO adaptive optics system on the VLT while the object was still amplified by a factor 1.23 and then at baseline 18 months later. We analyzed and calibrated the NACO photometry in the standard 2MASS system in order to accurately constrain the source and the lens star fluxes. Results: We detect light from the host star of
MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb, which significantly reduces the uncertainties in its characteristics as compared to earlier analyses. We find that
MOA-2007-BLG-192L is most likely a very low mass late type M-dwarf (0.084-0.012+0.015 M$\odot$) at a
distance of 660-70+100 pc orbited by a
3.2-1.8+5.2 M$\oplus$ super-Earth at
0.66-0.22+0.51 AU. We then discuss the properties of this cold planetary system.

We gathered 1066 spectra over four distinct transits with the STIS spectrometer on the Hubble Space Telescope using two gratings with a resolution R = 1500 and a combined wavelength range of 290-1030 nm. We divide the spectra into 10 spectrophotometric bandpasses, five for each grating, of equal wavelength span within each grating, and fit a transit curve over all bandpasses simultaneously. In our fit we use theoretical values for the stellar limb-darkening to further constrain the planetary radius. We find that the radius of HD 209458b is (1.320 $\pm$ 0.025) R Jup , which is a factor of 2 more precise than current estimates. We also obtain improved estimates for the orbital period P and time of center of transit T C . Although in principle the photon-limited precision of the STIS data should allow us to measure the timing of individual transits to a precision of 2-7 s, we find that uncertainties in the stellar limb-darkening coefficients and residual noise in the data degrade these measurements to a typical precision of $\pm$14 s. Within this level of error, we find no significant variations in the timing of the eight events examined in this work.},

  abstract = {High-contrast near-infrared imaging of the nearby star HR 8799 has shown three giant planets. Such images were possible because of the wide orbits ($>$25astronomical units, where 1AU is the Earth-Sun distance) and youth ($<$100Myr) of the imaged planets, which are still hot and bright as they radiate away gravitational energy acquired during their formation. An important area of contention in the exoplanet community is whether outer planets ($>$10AU) more massive than Jupiter form by way of one-step gravitational instabilities or, rather, through a two-step process involving accretion of a core followed by accumulation of a massive outer envelope composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Here we report the presence of a fourth planet, interior to and of about the same mass as the other three. The system, with this additional planet, represents a challenge for current planet formation models as none of them can explain the in situ formation of all four planets. With its four young giant planets and known cold/warm debris belts, the HR 8799 planetary system is a unique laboratory in which to study the formation and evolution of giant planets at wide ($>$10AU) separations.},

  doi = {10/gc3g2j},
  abstract = {Context. The detection of reflected light from an exoplanet is a 
difficult technical challenge at optical wavelengths. Even though this
signal is expected to replicate the stellar signal, not only is it
several orders of magnitude fainter, but it is also hidden among the
stellar noise. Aims: We apply a variant of the cross-correlation
technique to HARPS observations of 51 Peg to detect the reflected signal
from planet 51 Peg b. Methods: Our method
makes use of the cross-correlation function (CCF) of a binary mask with
high-resolution spectra to amplify the minute planetary signal that is
present in the spectra by a factor proportional to the number of
spectral lines when performing the cross correlation. The resulting
cross-correlation functions are then normalized by a stellar template to
remove the stellar signal. Carefully selected sections of the resulting
normalized CCFs are stacked to increase the planetary signal further.
The recovered signal allows probing several of the planetary properties,
including its real mass and albedo. Results: We detect evidence
for the reflected signal from planet 51 Peg b at a
significance of 3$\sigma$noise. The detection of the signal
permits us to infer a real mass of 0.46+0.06-0.01
MJup (assuming a stellar mass of 1.04 MSun) for
the planet and an orbital inclination of 80+10-19
degrees. The analysis of the data also allows us to infer a tentative
value for the (radius-dependent) geometric albedo of the planet. The
results suggest that 51Peg b may be an inflated hot
Jupiter with a high albedo (e.g., an albedo of 0.5 yields a radius of
1.9 $\pm$ 0.3 RJup for a signal amplitude of 6.0 $\pm$
0.4 \texttimes{} 10-5). Conclusions: We confirm that the
method we perfected can be used to retrieve an exoplanet's reflected
signal, even with current observing facilities. The advent of next
generation of instruments (e.g. VLT-ESO/ESPRESSO) and observing
facilities (e.g. a new generation of ELT telescopes) will yield new
opportunities for this type of technique to probe deeper into exoplanets
and their atmospheres.

Fomalhaut b lies about 119 astronomical units (AU) from the star and 18 AU of the dust belt, matching predictions of its location. Hubble Space Telescope observations separated by 1.73 years reveal counterclockwise orbital motion. Dynamical models of the interaction between the planet and the belt indicate that the planet's mass is at most three times that of Jupiter; a higher mass would lead to gravitational disruption of the belt, matching predictions of its location. The flux detected at 0.8 $\mu$m is also consistent with that of a planet with mass no greater than a few times that of Jupiter. The brightness at 0.6 $\mu$m and the lack of detection at longer wavelengths suggest that the detected flux may include starlight reflected off a circumplanetary disk, with dimension comparable to the orbits of the Galilean satellites.

Attempts to observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have hitherto proven unsuccessful10. Here we report adaptive optics observations of LkCa 15 that probe within the disk clearing. With accurate source positions over multiple epochs spanning 2009\textendash{}2015, we infer the presence of multiple companions on Keplerian orbits. We directly detect H$\alpha$ emission from the innermost companion, LkCa 15 b, evincing hot (about 10,000 kelvin) gas falling deep into the potential well of an accreting protoplanet.},

  abstract = {Since its discovery in 2008, the multi-planetary system around HR8799 has become a unique testbed for planet formation theories at large orbital radii and the study of non-irradiated planetary atmospheres. We present new SPHERE/IRDIS data in J, H, and K band, for the four planets HR8799bcde with SPHERE/IRDIS and YH-band spectra for planets d and e with SPHERE/IFS. We detect the closest planet HR8799e in J band for the first time. The astrometry gathered for three epochs of observation set new constraints on a hypothetical planet f. We combine the SPHERE photometry and spectra to demonstrate that the 1-5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m
spectral-energy distribution (SED) of the planets e and d can be represented by those of dusty -and young - L7 dwarfs. We show that the two outermost planet SEDs are well reproduced by the spectra of peculiar early-T dwarfs reddened by refractory grain opacities. This demonstrates that the planet peculiar photometric properties are dominated by the effect of dust, and suggests that the planets c, and then b, are less massive that the two innermost ones.},

  abstract = {Planned missions will spatially resolve temperate terrestrial planets from their host star. Although reflected light from such a planet encodes information about its surface, it has not been shown how to establish surface characteristics of a planet without assuming known surfaces to begin with. We present a reanalysis of disk-integrated, time-resolved, multiband photometry of Earth obtained by the Deep Impact spacecraft as part of the EPOXI Mission of Opportunity. We extract reflectance spectra of clouds, ocean, and land without a priori
knowledge of the numbers or colors of these surfaces. We show that the inverse problem of extracting surface spectra from such data is a novel and extreme instance of spectral unmixing, a well-studied problem in remote sensing. Principal component analysis is used to determine an appropriate number of model surfaces with which to interpret the data. Shrink-wrapping a simplex to the color excursions of the planet yields a conservative estimate of the planet's endmember spectra. The resulting surface maps are unphysical, however, requiring negative or
larger-than-unity surface coverage at certain locations. Our "rotational unmixing" supersedes the endmember analysis by simultaneously solving for the surface spectra and their geographical distributions on the planet, under the assumption of diffuse reflection and known viewing geometry. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo to determine best-fit parameters and their uncertainties. The resulting albedo spectra are similar to clouds, ocean, and land seen through a Rayleigh-scattering atmosphere. This study suggests that future direct-imaging efforts could identify and map unknown surfaces and clouds on exoplanets.},

  abstract = {Several exoplanets have recently been imaged at wide separations of 
$>$10 AU from their parent stars. These span a limited range of ages
($<$50 Myr) and atmospheric properties, with temperatures of 800-1800 K
and very red colors (J - H $>$ 0.5 mag), implying thick cloud
covers. Furthermore, substantial model uncertainties exist at these
young ages due to the unknown initial conditions at formation, which can
lead to an order of magnitude of uncertainty in the modeled planet mass.
Here, we report the direct-imaging discovery of a Jovian exoplanet
around the Sun-like star GJ 504, detected as part of the SEEDS survey.
The system is older than all other known directly imaged planets; as a
result, its estimated mass remains in the planetary regime independent
of uncertainties related to choices of initial conditions in the
exoplanet modeling. Using the most common exoplanet cooling model, and
given the system age of 160\^\{+350\}\_\{-60\} Myr, GJ 504b has an estimated
mass of 4\^\{+4.5\}\_\{-1.0\} Jupiter masses, among the lowest of directly
imaged planets. Its projected separation of 43.5 AU exceeds the typical
outer boundary of \textasciitilde{}30 AU predicted for the core accretion mechanism. GJ
504b is also significantly cooler (510\^\{+30\}\_\{-20\} K) and has a bluer
color (J - H = -0.23 mag) than previously imaged exoplanets,
suggesting a largely cloud-free atmosphere accessible to spectroscopic
characterization. Thus, it has the potential of providing novel insights
into the origins of giant planets as well as their atmospheric
properties.},

A basic option is for additional starshades to block the off- axis stars. An interesting option takes the form of hybrid operation of a starshade in conjunction with an internal starlight suppression. Two hybrid scenarios are considered. One such scenario includes the coronagraph instrument blocking the on-axis star, with the starshade blocking off-axis
starlight. Another scenario uses the wavefront control system in the coronagraph instrument and using a recent Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control (SNWC) technique can remove the off-axis stars leakage to enable a region of high-contrast around the on-axis star blocked by the starshade.

  abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets represents a challenge for astronomical 
instrumentation due to the high-contrast ratio and small angular
separation between the host star and the faint planet. Multi-star
systems pose additional challenges for coronagraphic instruments due to
the diffraction and aberration leakage caused by companion stars.
Consequently, many scientifically valuable multi-star systems are
excluded from direct imaging target lists for exoplanet surveys and
characterization missions. Multi-star Wavefront Control (MSWC) is a
technique that uses a coronagraphic instrument's deformable mirror
(DM) to create high-contrast regions in the focal plane in the presence
of multiple stars. MSWC uses ``non-redundant'' modes on the DM
to independently control speckles from each star in the dark zone. Our
previous paper also introduced the Super-Nyquist wavefront control
technique, which uses a diffraction grating to generate high-contrast
regions beyond the Nyquist limit (nominal region correctable by the DM).
These two techniques can be combined as MSWC-s to generate high-contrast
regions for multi-star systems at wide (Super-Nyquist) angular
separations, while MSWC-0 refers to close (Sub-Nyquist) angular
separations. As a case study, a high-contrast wavefront control
simulation that applies these techniques shows that the habitable region
of the Alpha Centauri system can be imaged with a small aperture at
8\texttimes{} \{10\}-9 mean raw contrast in 10\% broadband light in
one-sided dark holes from 1.6-5.5 $\lambda$/D. Another case study
using a larger 2.4 m aperture telescope such as the Wide-Field Infrared
Survey Telescope uses these techniques to image the habitable zone of
Alpha Centauri at 3.2\texttimes{} \{10\}-9 mean raw contrast in
monochromatic light.},

owing to the small angular separation and high contrast between
exoplanets and their host stars. High Dispersion Coronagraphy (HDC) is a
pathway to achieve unprecedented sensitivity to Earth-like planets in
the habitable zone. Here, we present a framework to simulate HDC
observations and data analyses. The goal of these simulations is to
perform a detailed analysis of the trade-off between raw star light
suppression and spectral resolution for various instrument
configurations, target types, and science cases. We predict the
performance of an HDC instrument at Keck observatory for characterizing
directly imaged gas-giant planets in near-infrared bands. We also
simulate HDC observations of an Earth-like planet using next-generation
ground-based (TMT) and spaced-base telescopes (HabEx and LUVOIR). We
conclude that ground-based ELTs are more suitable for HDC observations
of an Earth-like planet than future space-based missions owing to the
considerable difference in collecting area. For ground-based telescopes,
HDC observations can detect an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone
around an M-dwarf star at 10-4 star light suppression
level. Compared to the 10-7 planet/star contrast, HDC
relaxes the star light suppression requirement by a factor of
103. For space-based telescopes, detector noise will be a
major limitation at spectral resolutions higher than 104.
Considering detector noise and speckle chromatic noise, R = 400 (1600)
is the optimal spectral resolutions for HabEx (LUVOIR). The
corresponding star light suppression requirement to detect a planet with
planet/star contrast = 6.1\texttimes{} \{10\}-11 is relaxed by a
factor of 10 (100) for HabEx (LUVOIR).},

limited to planets close to the star and measure only the projected mass

are required to derive their physical characteristics. The star to
exoplanet intensity ratio ($>$108 in the near infrared) and
the relative separation ($<$ 0.5 arcseconds) significantly complicate
this endeavour. Current ground- and space-based direct imaging surveys
achieve an intensity ratio up to 104 at 0.5. separation, a
factor 10,000 from the desired goal. These surveys are limited by
uncorrected atmospheric turbulence and optical surface imperfections
that produce quasi-static speckles that look like exoplanets, but much
brighter. Two techniques will be discussed to attenuate this speckle
noise. The first is the Simultaneous Spectral Differential Imaging
technique (SSDI), acquiring a number of images simultaneously at
different adjacent narrowband wavelengths and combining them to
attenuate speckles. The second is the Angular Differential Imaging
technique (ADI), taking multiple observations while rotating the
telescope or waiting for sufficient field rotation to subtract static
speckles and to preserve the companion flux. Results from a dedicated
SSDI camera "TRIDENT" that was mounted under PUEO/CFHT and from an
ongoing ADI survey at Gemini with Altair/NIRI will be presented. Future
work involving a new type of detector, the Multi-Color Detector Assembly

  abstract = {The Kepler mission is uniquely suited to study the frequencies of extrasolar planets. This goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives such as eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound to them, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. We perform numerical simulations of the Kepler targets and of physical companions or stars in the background to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false positives detectable by the mission. Using real noise level estimates, we compute the number and characteristics of detectable eclipsing pairs involving main-sequence stars and non-main-sequence stars or planets, and we quantify the fraction of those that would pass the Kepler candidate vetting
procedure. By comparing their distribution with that of the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) detected during the first six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positive rate of Kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planet size, and orbital period. We find that the global false positive rate of Kepler is 9.4\%, peaking for giant planets (6-22 R $\oplus$) at 17.7\%,
reaching a low of 6.7\% for small Neptunes (2-4 R $\oplus$),
and increasing again for Earth-size planets (0.8-1.25 R
$\oplus$) to 12.3\%. Most importantly, we also quantify and
characterize the distribution and rate of occurrence of planets down to Earth size with no prior assumptions on their frequency, by subtracting from the population of actual Kepler candidates our simulated population of astrophysical false positives. We find that 16.5\% $\pm$ 3.6\% of
main-sequence FGK stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25 R $\oplus$ with orbital periods up to 85 days. This result is a significant step toward the determination of eta-earth, the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their parent stars. There is no significant dependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 Earth radii with spectral type. In the process, we also derive a prescription for the signal recovery rate of Kepler that enables a good match to both the KOI size and orbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.},

  abstract = {Context. Co-orbital bodies are the byproduct of planet formation and evolution, as we know from the solar system. Although planet-size co-orbitals do not exists in our planetary system, dynamical studies show that they can remain stable for long periods of time in the gravitational well of massive planets. Should they exist, their detection is feasible with the current instrumentation. \\
 Aims: In this paper, we present new ground-based observations searching for these bodies co-orbiting with nine close-in (P \&lt; 5 days) planets, using various observing techniques. The combination of all of these techniques allows us to restrict the parameter space of any possible trojan in the system. \\
 Methods: We used multi-technique observations, comprised of radial velocity, precision photometry, and transit timing variations, both newly acquired in the context of the TROY project and publicly available, to constrain the presence of planet-size trojans in the Lagrangian points of nine known exoplanets. \\
 Results: We find no clear evidence of trojans in these nine systems through any of the techniques used down to the precision of the observations. However, this allows us to constrain the presence of any potential trojan in the system, especially in the trojan mass or radius vs. libration amplitude plane. In particular, we can set upper mass limits in the super-Earth mass regime for six of the studied systems.

models are limited by the existence of degeneracies on their
compositions. Here, we present a model of internal structure dedicated to the study of solid planets up to \texttildelow{}10 Earth masses, I.e.,
super-Earths. When the measurement is available, the assumption that the bulk Fe/Si ratio of a planet is similar to that of its host star allows us to significantly reduce the existing degeneracy and more precisely constrain the planet's composition. Based on our model, we provide an update of the mass-radius relationships used to provide a first estimate of a planet's composition from density measurements. Our model is also applied to the cases of two well-known exoplanets, CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, using their recently updated parameters. The core mass fractions of CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b are found to lie within the 10\%-37\% and 10\%-33\% ranges, respectively, allowing both
planets to be compatible with an Earth-like composition. We also extend the recent study of Proxima Centauri b and show that its radius may reach 1.94 \{R\}$\backslash$oplus in the case of a 5 \{M\}$\backslash$oplus planet, as there is a 96.7\% probability that the real mass of Proxima Centauri b is below this value.},

At these high temperatures, iron and several other transition metals are not sequestered in molecules or cloud particles and exist solely in their atomic forms\textsuperscript{5}. However, despite being the most abundant transition metal in nature, iron has not hitherto been detected directly in an exoplanet because it is highly refractory. The high temperatures of KELT-9b imply that its atmosphere is a tightly constrained chemical system that is expected to be nearly in chemical equilibrium\textsuperscript{5} and cloud-free\textsuperscript{6,7}, and it has been predicted that spectral lines of iron should be detectable in the visible range of wavelengths\textsuperscript{5}.

  abstract = {Optical phase curves have become one of the common probes of exoplanetary atmospheres, but the information they encode has not been fully elucidated. Building on a diverse body of work, we upgrade the Flexible Modelling System to include scattering in the two-stream, dual-band approximation and generate plausible, three-dimensional structures of irradiated atmospheres to study the radiative effects of aerosols or condensates. In the optical, we treat the scattering of starlight using a generalization of Beer's law that allows for a finite Bond albedo to be prescribed. In the infrared, we implement the two-stream solutions and include scattering via an infrared scattering parameter. We present a suite of four-parameter general circulation models for Kepler-7b and demonstrate that its climatology is expected to be robust to variations in optical and infrared scattering. The westward and eastward shifts of the optical and infrared phase curves, respectively, are shown to be robust outcomes of the simulations. Assuming micron-sized particles and a simplified treatment of local brightness, we further show that the peak offset of the optical phase curve is sensitive to the composition of the aerosols or condensates. However, to within the measurement uncertainties, we cannot distinguish between aerosols made of silicates (enstatite or forsterite), iron, corundum or titanium oxide, based on a comparison to the measured peak offset (41$^\circ$ $\pm$ 12$^\circ$) of the optical phase curve of Kepler-7b. Measuring high-precision optical phase curves will provide important constraints on the atmospheres of cloudy exoplanets and reduce degeneracies in interpreting their infrared spectra.},

In this study, we provide an analytic framework to interpret observed phase curves, geometric albedos, and polarization of giant planet atmospheres. We compute the observables for non-conservative Rayleigh scattering in homogeneous semi-infinite atmospheres using both scalar and vector formalisms. In addition, we compute phase curves and albedos for Lambertian, isotropic, and anisotropic scattering phase functions. We provide analytic expressions for geometric albedos and spherical albedos as a function of the scattering albedo for Rayleigh scattering in semi-infinite atmospheres. Given an observed geometric albedo our prescriptions can be used to estimate the underlying scattering albedo of the atmosphere, which in turn is indicative of the scattering and absorptive properties of the atmosphere. We also study the dependence of polarization in Rayleigh scattering atmospheres on the orbital parameters of the planet-star system, particularly on the orbital inclination. We show how the orbital inclination of non-transiting exoplanets can be constrained from their observed polarization parameters. We consolidate the formalism, solution techniques, and results from analytic models available in the literature, often scattered in various sources, and present a systematic procedure to compute albedos, phase curves, and polarization of reflected light.},

After correcting for systematics, we found eight systems that show secondary eclipses as well as phase variations. Of these, five (Kepler-5, Kepler-6, Kepler-8, KOI-64, and KOI-2133) are new and three (TrES-2, HAT-P-7, and KOI-13) have published phase curves, albeit with many fewer observations. We model the full phase curve of each planet candidate, including the primary and secondary transits, and derive their albedos, dayside and nightside temperatures, ellipsoidal variations, and Doppler beaming. We find that KOI-64 and KOI-2133 have nightside temperatures well above their equilibrium values (while KOI-2133 also has an albedo, \&gt;1), so we conclude that they are likely to be self-luminous objects rather than planets. The other six candidates have characteristics consistent with their being planets with low geometric albedos (\&lt;0.3). For TrES-2 and KOI-13, the Kepler bandpass appears to probe atmospheric layers hotter than the planet's equilibrium temperature. For KOI-13, we detect a never-before-seen third cosine harmonic with an amplitude of 6.7 $\pm$ 0.3 ppm and a phase shift of -1.1 $\pm$ 0.1 rad in the phase curve residual, possibly due to its spin-orbit misalignment. We report derived planetary parameters for all six planets, including masses from ellipsoidal variations and Doppler beaming, and compare our results to published values when available. Our results nearly double the number of Kepler exoplanets with measured phase curve variations, thus providing valuable constraints on the properties of hot Jupiters.},

  abstract = {Next-generation space telescopes will observe the atmospheres of rocky 
planets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs. Understanding these observations will
require well-developed theory in addition to numerical simulations. Here
we present theoretical models for the temperature structure and
atmospheric circulation of dry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with
gray radiative transfer and test them using a general circulation model
(GCM). First, we develop a radiative-convective (RC) model that captures
surface temperatures of slowly rotating and cool atmospheres. Second, we
show that the atmospheric circulation acts as a global heat engine,
which places strong constraints on large-scale wind speeds. Third, we
develop an RC-subsiding model which extends our RC model to hot and thin
atmospheres. We find that rocky planets develop large day-night
temperature gradients at a ratio of wave-to-radiative timescales up to
two orders of magnitude smaller than the value suggested by work on hot
Jupiters. The small ratio is due to the heat engine inefficiency and
asymmetry between updrafts and subsidence in convecting atmospheres.
Fourth, we show, using GCM simulations, that rotation only has a strong
effect on temperature structure if the atmosphere is hot or thin. Our
models let us map out atmospheric scenarios for planets such as GJ
1132b, and show how thermal phase curves could constrain them. Measuring
phase curves of short-period planets will require similar amounts of
time on the James Webb Space Telescope as detecting molecules via
transit spectroscopy, so future observations should pursue both
techniques.},

Atmospheric dynamics sets the background state of density, temperature, and velocity that determines or influences the spectral and temporal appearance of an exoplanetary atmosphere. Hot exoplanets are most amenable to these characterization techniques. In this review, we focus on highly irradiated, large exoplanets (the hot Jupiters), as astronomical data begin to confront theoretical questions. We summarize the basic atmospheric quantities inferred from the astronomical observations. We review the state of the art by addressing a series of current questions, and look toward the future by considering a separate set of exploratory questions. Attaining the next level of understanding requires a concerted effort of constructing multifaceted, multiwavelength datasets for benchmark objects. Understanding clouds presents a formidable obstacle, as they introduce degeneracies into the interpretation of spectra, yet their properties and existence are directly influenced by atmospheric dynamics. Confronting general circulation models with these multifaceted, multiwavelength datasets will help us understand these and other degeneracies.},

unleash the power of the Cross Correlation Function in combination with
the collecting power of next generation observing facilities. The
technique we propose has already yielded positive results by detecting
the reflected spectral signature of 51 Pegasi b (see Martins et al.

  abstract = {`Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked because they are close ($<$0.05 astronomical units, where 1 au is the average Sun\textendash{}Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets1,2,3. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems4,5,6, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a `map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973 $\pm$ 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1,212 $\pm$ 11 K at a wavelength of 8 $\mu$m, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter7. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16 $\pm$ 6$^\circ$ before opposition, corresponding to a hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 $\pm$ 24 s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.},

In addition, there is a provocative detection of the light reflected off of the giant planet $\tau$ Bootis b. Including the effects of stellar irradiation, we estimate the general behavior of radius/age trajectories for such planets and interpret the large measured radii of HD 209458b and $\tau$ Boo b in that context. We find that HD 209458b must be a hydrogen-rich gas giant. Furthermore, the large radius of a close-in gas giant is not due to the thermal expansion of its atmosphere but to the high residual entropy that remains throughout its bulk by dint of its early proximity to a luminous primary. The large stellar flux does not inflate the planet but retards its otherwise inexorable contraction from a more extended configuration at birth. This implies either that such a planet was formed near its current orbital distance or that it migrated in from larger distances ($\geq$0.5 AU), no later than a few times 10 7 yr of birth.},

The planet's atmosphere could be dominated by relatively heavy molecules, such as water (for example, a 100 per cent water vapour composition), or it could contain high-altitude clouds that obscure its lower layers. Here we report a measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b at near-infrared wavelengths that definitively resolves this ambiguity. The data, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, are sufficiently precise to detect absorption features from a high mean-molecular-mass atmosphere. The observed spectrum, however, is featureless. We rule out cloud-free atmospheric models with compositions dominated by water, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrogen or carbon dioxide at greater than 5$\sigma$ confidence. The planet's atmosphere must contain clouds to be consistent with the data.},

measurements have been taken across the H and K bands. These data are combined with previously published photometry for an analysis of the planet's atmospheric properties. Thick photospheric dust cloud opacity is invoked to explain the planet's red near-IR colors and relatively smooth near-IR spectrum. Strong water absorption is detected, indicating a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Only weak CH4 absorption is detected at K band, indicating efficient vertical mixing and a
disequilibrium CO/CH4 ratio at photospheric depths. The H-band spectrum has a distinct triangular shape consistent with low surface gravity. New giant planet atmosphere models are compared to these data with best-fitting bulk parameters, T eff = 1100 K $\pm$100 and log (g) = 3.5 $\pm$ 0.5 (for solar composition).
Given the observed luminosity (log L obs/L sun \textasciitilde{} - 5.1), these values correspond to a radius of 0.75 R Jup +0.17 - 0.12 and a mass of \textasciitilde{}0.72 M Jup +2.6 - 0.6\textemdash{}strikingly inconsistent with

The larger effective radius observed at visible wavelengths9 may arise from either stellar variability or the presence of clouds/hazes.

  abstract = {Context. During primary transits, the spectral signatures of exoplanet 
atmospheres can be measured using transmission spectroscopy. We can
obtain information on the upper atmosphere of these planets by
investigating the exoplanets' excess sodium absorption in the optical
region. However, a number of factors can affect the observed sodium
absorption signature. We present a detailed model correcting for
systematic biases to yield an accurate depth for the sodium absorption
in HD 189733b. Aims: The goal of this work is to accurately
measure the atomspheric sodium absorption light curve in HD 189733b,
correcting for the effects of stellar differential limb-darkening,
stellar activity, and a "bump" caused by the changing radial velocity of
the exoplanet. In fact, owing to the high cadence and quality of our
data, it is the first time that the last feature can be detected even by
visual inspection. Methods: We use 244 high-resolution optical
spectra taken by the UVES instrument mounted at the VLT. Our
observations cover a full transit of HD 189733b, with a cadence of 45 s.
To probe the transmission spectrum of sodium we produce excess light
curves integrating the stellar flux in passbands of 1 \AA, 1.5
\AA, and 3 \AA{} inside the core of each sodium D-line. We model
the effects of external sources on the excess light curves, which
correspond to an observed stellar flare beginning close to mid-transit
time and the wavelength dependent limb-darkening effects. In addition,
by characterizing the effect of the changing radial velocity and Doppler
shifts of the planetary sodium lines inside the stellar sodium lines, we
estimate the depth and width of the exoplanetary sodium feature. 
Results: We estimate the shape of the planetary sodium line by a
Gaussian profile with an equivalent width of 0.0023 $\pm$
0.0010\AA, thereby confirming the presence of sodium in the
atmosphere of HD 189733b with excess absorption levels of 0.72 $\pm$
0.25\%, 0.34 $\pm$ 0.11\%, and 0.20 $\pm$ 0.06\% for the integration
bands of 1 \AA, 1.5 \AA, and 3 \AA, respectively. Using the
equivalent width of the planetary sodium line, we produce a first order
estimate of the number density of sodium in the exoplanet atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Context. Broadband secondary-eclipse measurements of strongly irradiated 
hot Jupiters have indicated the existence of atmospheric thermal
inversions, but their presence is difficult to determine from broadband
measurements because of degeneracies between molecular abundances and
temperature structure. Furthermore, the primary mechanisms that drive
the inversion layers in hot-Jupiter atmospheres are unknown. This
question cannot be answered without reliable identification of thermal
inversions. Aims: We apply high-resolution (R = 100 000) infrared
spectroscopy to probe the temperature-pressure profile of HD 209458b.
This bright, transiting hot-Jupiter has long been considered the gold
standard for a hot Jupiter with an inversion layer, but this has been
challenged in recent publications. Methods: We observed the
thermal dayside emission of HD 209458b with the CRyogenic Infra-Red
Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES) on the Very Large Telescope during three
nights, targeting the carbon monoxide band at 2.3 $\mu$m. Thermal
inversions give rise to emission features, which means that detecting
emission lines in the planetary spectrum, as opposed to absorption
lines, would be direct evidence of a region in which the temperature
increases with altitude. Results: We do not detect any
significant absorption or emission of CO in the dayside spectrum of HD
209458b, although cross-correlation with template spectra either with CO
absorption lines or with weak emission at the core of the lines show a
low-significance correlation signal with asignal - to - noiseratioof
\textasciitilde{}3-3.5. Models with strong CO emission lines show a weak
anti-correlation with similar or lower significance levels. Furthermore,
we found no evidence of absorption or emission from H2O at
these wavelengths. Conclusions: The non-detection of CO in the
dayside spectrum of HD 209458b is interesting in light of a previous CO
detection in the transmission spectrum. That there is no signal
indicates that HD 209458b either has a nearly isothermal atmosphere or
that the signal is heavily muted. Assuming a clear atmosphere, we can
rule out a full-disc dayside inversion layer in the pressure range 1 bar
to 1 mbar.

  shorttitle = {Combining High-Dispersion Spectroscopy ({{HDS}}) with High Contrast Imaging ({{HCI}})},
  abstract = {Aims: In this work, we discuss a way to combine High Dispersion Spectroscopy and High Contrast Imaging (HDS+HCI). For a planet located at a resolvable angular distance from its host star, the starlight can be reduced up to several orders of magnitude using adaptive optics and/or coronography. In addition, the remaining starlight can be filtered out using high-dispersion spectroscopy, utilizing the significantly different (or Doppler shifted) high-dispersion spectra of the planet and star. In this way, HDS+HCI can in principle reach contrast limits of \textasciitilde{}1e-5 x 1e-5, although in practice this will be limited by photon noise and/or sky-background. Methods: We present simulations of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT, both probing thermal emission from a planet at infrared wavelengths, and starlight reflected off a planet atmosphere at optical wavelengths. For the infrared simulations we use the baseline parameters of the E-ELT and METIS instrument, with the latter combining extreme adaptive optics with an R=100,000 IFS. We include realistic models of the adaptive optics performance and atmospheric transmission and emission. For the optical simulation we also assume R=100,000 IFS with adaptive optics capabilities at the E-ELT. Results: One night of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT at 4.8 um (d\_lambda = 0.07 um) can detect a planet orbiting alpha Cen A with a radius of R=1.5 R\_earth and a twin-Earth thermal spectrum of T\_eq=300 K at a signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5. In the optical, with a Strehl ratio performance of 0.3, reflected light from an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri can be detected at a S/N of 10 in the same time frame. Recently, first HDS+HCI observations have shown the potential of this technique by determining the spin-rotation of the young massive exoplanet beta Pictoris b. [abridged]},

  abstract = {We have recently carried out spectral synthesis modeling to determine Teff, logg, vsini, and [Fe/H] for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs. This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K$>$30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3\% of stars with
-0.5$<$[Fe/H]$<$0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar
metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H]$>$+0.3 dex, 25\% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil
signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or
eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.

Based on observations obtained at Lick and Keck Observatories, operated by the University of California, and the Anglo-Australian Observatories.},

  abstract = {We present stellar parameters and metallicities, obtained from a 
detailed spectroscopic analysis, for a large sample of 98 stars known to
be orbited by planetary mass companions (almost all known targets), as
well as for a volume-limited sample of 41 stars not known to host any
planet. For most of the stars the stellar parameters are revised
versions of the ones presented in our previous work. However, we also
present parameters for 18 stars with planets not previously published,
and a compilation of stellar parameters for the remaining 4 planet-hosts
for which we could not obtain a spectrum. A comparison of our stellar
parameters with values of Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] available
in the literature shows a remarkable agreement. In particular, our
spectroscopic log g values are now very close to trigonometric log g
estimates based on Hipparcos parallaxes. The derived [Fe/H] values are
then used to confirm the previously known result that planets are more
prevalent around metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we confirm that the
frequency of planets is a strongly rising function of the stellar
metallicity, at least for stars with [Fe/H] $>$ 0. While only about 3\%
of the solar metallicity stars in the CORALIE planet search sample were
found to be orbited by a planet, this number increases to more than 25\%
for stars with [Fe/H] above +0.3. Curiously, our results also suggest
that these percentages might remain relatively constant for values of
[Fe/H] lower than about solar, increasing then linearly with the mass
fraction of heavy elements. These results are discussed in the context
of the theories of planetary formation.

  abstract = {Context. A first characterization of extrasolar planets by the 
observational determination of the radius has recently been achieved for
a large number of planets. For some planets, a measurement of the
luminosity has also been possible, with many more directly imaged
planets expected in the near future. The statistical characterization of
exoplanets through their mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagram is
becoming possible. This is for planet formation and evolution theory of
similar importance as the mass-distance diagram. Aims: Our aim is
to extend our planet-formation model into a coupled formation and
evolution model. We want to calculate from one single model in a
self-consistent way all basic quantities describing a planet: its mass,
semimajor axis, composition, radius, and luminosity. We then want to use
this model for population synthesis calculations. Methods: In
this and a companion paper, we show how we solve the structure equations
describing the gaseous envelope of a protoplanet during the
early-formation phase, the gas runaway accretion phase, and the
evolutionary phase at constant mass on Gyr timescales. We improve the
model further with a new prescription for the disk-limited gas accretion
rate, an internal structure model for the planetary core assuming a
differentiated interior, and the inclusion of radioactive decay as an
additional heat source in the core. Results: We study the in situ
formation and evolution of Jupiter, the mass-radius relationship of
giant planets, the influence of the core mass on the radius, and the
luminosity both in the "hot start" and the "cold start" scenario.
Special emphasis is placed on the validation of the model by comparing
it with other models of planet formation and evolution. We find that our
results agree very well with those of more complex models, despite a
number of simplifications we make in our calculations. 
Conclusions: The upgraded model yields the most important physical
quantities describing a planet from its beginning as a tiny seed embryo
to a Gyr-old planet. This is the case for all planets in a synthetic
planetary population. Therefore, we can now use self-consistently the
observational constraints coming from all major observational
techniques. This is important in a time where different techniques yield
constraints on very diverse sub-populations of planets, and where it is
difficult to put all these constraints together in one coherent picture.
Our comprehensive formation and evolution model should be helpful in
this situation for the understanding of exoplanets.},

In the companion paper (Paper I), we presented in detail the methods we use. In subsequent papers, we shall discuss the effect of the host star's mass on the planetary population and the influence of various properties of protoplanetary disks. \\
Aims: In this second paper, we focus on planets orbiting solar-like stars. The goal is to use the main characteristics of the actually observed extrasolar planet population to derive in a statistical manner constraints on the planet formation models. \\
Methods: Drawing initial conditions for our models at random from probability distributions derived as closely as possible from observations, we synthesize a number of planetary populations. By applying an observational detection bias appropriate for radial velocity surveys, we identify the potentially detectable synthetic planets. The properties of these planets are compared in quantitative statistical tests with the properties of a carefully selected sub-population of actually observed extrasolar planets. \\
Results: We use a two dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the mass-distance distributions of synthetic and observed planets, as well as the one dimensional version of the test to compare the M sin i, the semimajor axis and the [Fe/H] distribution. We find that while many combinations of parameters lead to unacceptable distributions, a number of models can account to a reasonable degree of statistical significance for most of the properties of the observed sample. We concurrently account for many other observed features, e.g. the ``metallicity effect''. This gives us confidence that our model captures several essential features of giant planet formation. In addition, the fact that many parameter combinations could be rejected indicates that planet population synthesis is indeed a promising approach to constrain formation models. Our simulations allow us also to extract a number of properties of the underlying exoplanet population that are not yet directly detectable. For example, we have derived the planetary initial mass function (PIMF) and have been led to conclude that the planets detected so far represent only the tip of the iceberg (9\%) of all the existing planets. The PIMF can also be used to predict how the detectable extrasolar planet population will change as the instrumental precision of radial velocity surveys improves from \textasciitilde{}10 m/s to \textasciitilde{}1 m/s, or even to an extreme precision of 0.1 m/s.},

  abstract = {We use new interior models of cold planets to investigate the mass-radius relationships of solid exoplanets, considering planets made primarily of iron, silicates, water, and carbon compounds. We find that the mass-radius relationships for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic functional form that is not a simple power law:
log10Rs=k1+1/3log10(Ms)-k2Mk3s
for up to Mp\textasciitilde{}20 M$\oplus$, where Ms and
Rs are scaled mass and radius values. This functional form
arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have
equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of
the form $\rho$=$\rho$0+cPn. We find that highly
detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and
phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk
composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with
no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5\%
fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to
distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or
water ice but not more detailed compositions; with \textasciitilde{}5\% uncertainty water
ice planets with $>$\textasciitilde{}25\% water by mass may be identified; the minimum
plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet;
and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of
silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and
equations of state. We propose a definition of ‘‘super-Earths'' based on
the clear distinction in radii between planets with significant gas
envelopes and those without.},

information on the distribution of planetary radii, particularly for the
new populations of super-Earth- and sub-Neptune-sized planets. In order
to aid in the physical interpretation of these radii, we compute model
radii for low-mass rocky planets with hydrogen-helium envelopes. We
provide model radii for planets 1-20 M $\oplus$, with envelope
fractions 0.01\%-20\%, levels of irradiation 0.1-1000 times Earth's, and
ages from 100 Myr to 10 Gyr. In addition we provide simple analytic fits
that summarize how radius depends on each of these parameters. Most
importantly, we show that at fixed H/He envelope fraction, radii show
little dependence on mass for planets with more than \textasciitilde{}1\% of their mass
in their envelope. Consequently, planetary radius is to a first order a
proxy for planetary composition, i.e., H/He envelope fraction, for
Neptune- and sub-Neptune-sized planets. We recast the observed

it in light of traditional core accretion theory. We discuss the

This variety of the hydrogen equations of state translate into an uncertainty in Jupiter's core mass of 18M$\oplus$.

  abstract = {There is no universally acknowledged criterion to distinguish brown dwarfs from planets. Numerous studies have used or suggested a
definition based on an object's mass, taking the \textasciitilde{}13 Jupiter mass (MJ ) limit for the ignition of deuterium. Here, we
investigate various deuterium-burning masses for a range of models. We find that, while 13 MJ is generally a reasonable rule of thumb, the deuterium fusion mass depends on the helium abundance, the initial deuterium abundance, the metallicity of the model, and on what fraction of an object's initial deuterium abundance must combust in order for the object to qualify as having burned deuterium. Even though, for most proto-brown dwarf conditions, 50\% of the initial deuterium will burn if the object's mass is \textasciitilde{}(13.0 $\pm$ 0.8) MJ , the
full range of possibilities is significantly broader. For models ranging from zero-metallicity to more than three times solar metallicity, the deuterium-burning mass ranges from \textasciitilde{}11.0 MJ (for three times solar metallicity, 10\% of initial deuterium burned) to \textasciitilde{}16.3
MJ ( for zero metallicity, 90\% of initial deuterium burned).},

  abstract = {The Kepler mission, combined with ground-based radial velocity (RV) follow-up and dynamical analyses of transit timing variations, has revolutionized the observational constraints on sub-Neptune-sized planet compositions. The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have RV mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a
hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck RV follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than $\sim$50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of 1.6 \{\{R\}$\backslash$oplus \} planets have too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of ``Earth-like'' planets,

  abstract = {We measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, KOI-94d. We wish to determine whether this planet, which is in a 22 day orbit and receives 2700 times as much incident flux as Jupiter, is as dense as Jupiter or rarefied like inflated hot Jupiters. KOI-94 also hosts at least three smaller transiting planets, all of which were detected by the Kepler mission. With 26 radial velocities of KOI-94 from the W. M. Keck Observatory and a simultaneous fit to the Kepler light curve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is not inflated. Support for the planetary interpretation of the other three candidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timing variations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against false positives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within the photometric aperture. We report the properties of KOI-94b (M P = 10.5 $\pm$ 4.6 M $\oplus$, R
P = 1.71 $\pm$ 0.16 R $\oplus$, P = 3.74 days),
KOI-94c (M P = 15.6\^\{+5.7\}\_\{-15.6\} M $\oplus$, R
P = 4.32 $\pm$ 0.41 R $\oplus$, P = 10.4 days),
KOI-94d (M P = 106 $\pm$ 11 M $\oplus$, R
P = 11.27 $\pm$ 1.06 R $\oplus$, P = 22.3 days),
and KOI-94e (M P = 35\^\{+18\}\_\{-28\} M $\oplus$, R
P = 6.56 $\pm$ 0.62 R $\oplus$, P = 54.3 days).
The radial velocity analyses of KOI-94b and KOI-94e offer marginal ($>$2$\sigma$) mass detections, whereas the observations of KOI-94c
offer only an upper limit to its mass. Using the KOI-94 system and other planets with published values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35 with M P $<$ 150 M $\oplus$),
we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanets that relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few Earth masses up to 13 Jupiter masses: (R P/R $\oplus$) = 1.78(M P/M
$\oplus$)0.53(F/erg s-1
cm-2)-0.03 for M P $<$ 150
M $\oplus$, and R P/R $\oplus$ = 2.45(M
P/M $\oplus$)-0.039(F/erg
s-1 cm-2)0.094 for M
P $>$ 150 M $\oplus$. These equations can be used
to predict the radius or mass of a planet.

  abstract = {Accuracy levels of metres per second require the fundamental concept of ‘‘radial velocity'' for stars and other distant objects to be examined, both as a physical velocity, and as measured by spectroscopic and astrometric techniques. Already in a classical (non-relativistic) framework the line-of-sight velocity component is an ambiguous concept, depending on whether, e.g., the time of light emission (at the object) or that of light detection (by the observer) is used for recording the time coordinate. Relativistic velocity effects and spectroscopic measurements made inside gravitational fields add further complications, causing wavelength shifts to depend, e.g., on the transverse velocity of the object and the gravitational potential at the source. Aiming at definitions that are unambiguous at accuracy levels of 1 m
s-1, we analyse different concepts of radial velocity and their interrelations. At this accuracy level, a strict separation must be made between the purely geometric concepts on one hand, and the spectroscopic measurement on the other. Among the geometric concepts we define kinematic radial velocity, which corresponds most closely to the ‘‘textbook definition'' of radial velocity as the line-of-sight
component of space velocity; and astrometric radial velocity, which can be derived from astrometric observations. Consistent with these
definitions, we propose strict definitions also of the complementary kinematic and astrometric quantities, namely transverse velocity and proper motion. The kinematic and astrometric radial velocities depend on the chosen spacetime metric, and are accurately related by simple coordinate transformations. On the other hand, the observational quantity that should result from accurate spectroscopic measurements is the barycentric radial-velocity measure. This is independent of the metric, and to first order equals the line-of-sight velocity. However, it is not a physical velocity, and cannot be accurately transformed to a kinematic or astrometric radial velocity without additional assumptions and data in modelling the process of light emission from the source, the transmission of the signal through space, and its recording by the observer. For historic and practical reasons, the spectroscopic
radial-velocity measure is expressed in velocity units as
czB, where c is the speed of light and zB is the observed relative wavelength shift reduced to the solar-system
barycentre, at an epoch equal to the barycentric time of light arrival. The barycentric radial-velocity measure and the astrometric radial velocity are defined by recent resolutions adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the motives and consequences of which are explained in this paper.},

  abstract = {Astronomical spectra taken with ground-based telescopes in the near-IR spectral region are affected by strong absorptions due to molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, particularly CO2 and H2O. These features need to be removed in order to reveal the true spectrum of the object being observed. The traditional technique for doing this is to observe a standard star with a relatively featureless spectrum (a smooth spectrum standard) and divide the observed spectrum of the object by that of the standard. This technique has a number of practical difficulties but is also fundamentally flawed. Even with a perfectly smooth spectrum standard observed at an identical air mass to the object, this technique does not, in general, reproduce the spectrum of the object that would have been observed in the absence of the Earth's atmosphere. The problem arises because of the presence of
high-resolution structure in the molecular absorption features,
generally on a finer scale than the resolution of the observed spectrum. The transmission of the Earth's atmosphere for any spectral bin then depends on the unresolved spectral structure of the light being
transmitted and cannot be represented by a unique value derived from the standard star, as the traditional technique assumes. We use
high-resolution line-by-line radiative transfer models to quantify these effects for two cases: observations of a solar-type star, and
observations of the planet Mars. For a solar-type star, application of the traditional technique causes errors of a few percent in the vicinity of strong atmospheric absorption features. The case of the planet Mars is an extreme case, since Mars has the same CO2 absorption features as the Earth's atmosphere. Our simulations show that applying the traditional astronomical technique to ground-based spectra of the planet Mars leads to systematic errors of up to \textasciitilde{}50\% in the vicinity of the strong CO2 absorption features. High-quality IR
spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes requires an improved technique to handle the absorption in the Earth's atmosphere. We outline a possible approach based on the use of radiative transfer models for the Earth's atmosphere. We note that in general it is not possible to correct observed spectra for atmospheric absorption. However, a
forward-modeling approach can be used in which a model spectrum for the object is generated, atmospheric transmission effects added, and the result compared with the observed spectrum. We present a demonstration of the ability of a model to accurately represent the Earth atmosphere transmission in the J band.},

field star sequences in M\_V-(V-I), M\_K-(I-K) and M\_K-(J-K) diagrams.
These comparisons show that the most recent improvements performed in
low-mass star atmosphere models yield now reliable stellar models in the
near-infrared. These models can be used for metallicity, mass,
temperature and luminosity calibrations. Uncertainties still remain,
however, in the optical spectral region below T\_eff \textasciitilde{} 3700K, where
predicted (V-I) colors are too blue by 0.5 mag for a given magnitude.
The possible origins for such a discrepancy, most likely a missing
source of opacity in the optical and the onset of grain formation are
examined in detail. Tables 1 to 3 are only available in electronic form

distribution-function representation of the opacity of almost a million atomic lines. For each model the temperature structure, fluxes, UBV and uvby colors, bolometric correction, and Balmer line profiles are tabulated. The solar-abundance models are compared with narrow-, intermediate-, and wide-band photometry and found to be in good
agreement with the observations for effective temperatures above 8000 K. Excellent agreement exists with the spectrophotometry and Balmer line profiles of Vega. A small systematic error in the colors of late A and F stars is probably due to an overstimate of convection in weakly
convective models. This error does not seem to affect greatly the use of the predicted colors for differential studies. The solar model has approximately a 2\% error in the V flux because molecular lines were not included.},

The models include the formation of over 600 gas-phase species and 1000 liquids and crystals and the opacities of 30 different types of grains including corundum (Al2O3), the magnesium aluminum spinel
MgAl2O4, iron, enstatite (MgSiO3), forsterite (Mg2SiO4), amorphous carbon, SiC, and a number of calcium silicates. The models extend from the beginning of the grain formation regime well into the condensation regime of water ice (Teff=3000-100 K) and encompass the range of logg=2.5-6.0 at solar metallicity. We find that silicate dust grains can form abundantly in the outer atmospheric layers of red and brown dwarfs with a spectral type later than M8. The greenhouse effects of dust opacities provide a natural explanation for the peculiarly red spectroscopic distribution of the latest M dwarfs and young brown dwarfs. The grainless (cond) models, on the other hand, correspond closely to methane brown dwarfs such as Gliese 229B. We also discover that the $\lambda\lambda$5891, 5897 Na I D
and $\lambda\lambda$7687, 7701 K I resonance doublets play a critical
role in T dwarfs, in which their red wings define the pseudocontinuum from the I to the Z bandpass.},

  abstract = {Context. Observationally, spectra of brown dwarfs indicate the presence 
of dust in their atmospheres while theoretically it is not clear what
prevents the dust from settling and disappearing from the regions of
spectrum formation. Consequently, standard models have to rely on ad hoc
assumptions about the mechanism that keeps dust grains aloft in the
atmosphere. Aims: We apply hydrodynamical simulations to develop
an improved physical understanding of the mixing properties of
macroscopic flows in M dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres, in particular
of the influence of the underlying convection zone. Methods: We
performed two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations including
a description of dust grain formation and transport with the CO5BOLD
code. The simulations cover the very top of the convection zone and the
photosphere including the dust layers for a sequence of effective
temperatures between 900 K and 2800 K, all with log g = 5 assuming solar
chemical composition. Results: Convective overshoot occurs in the
form of exponentially declining velocities with small scale heights, so
that it affects only the region immediately above the almost adiabatic
convective layers. From there on, mixing is provided by gravity waves
that are strong enough to maintain thin dust clouds in the hotter
models. With decreasing effective temperature, the amplitudes of the
waves become smaller but the clouds become thicker and develop internal
convective flows that are more efficient in transporting and mixing
material than gravity waves. The presence of clouds often leads to a
highly structured appearance of the stellar surface on short temporal
and small spatial scales (presently inaccessible to observations). Conclusions: We identify convectively excited gravity waves as an
essential mixing process in M dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres. Under
conditions of strong cloud formation, dust convection is the dominant
self-sustaining mixing component.},

arbitrary velocity fields in the Eulerian frame is presented. The method
is implemented in our 3D radiative transfer framework and used in the
PHOENIX/3D code. It is tested by comparison to our well-tested 1D
co-moving frame radiative transfer code, where the treatment of a
monotonic velocity field is implemented in the Lagrangian frame. The
Eulerian formulation does not need much additional memory and is useable
on state-of-the-art computers, even large-scale applications with 1000's
of wavelength points are feasible. Methods: In the Eulerian
formulation of the problem, the photon is seen by the atom at a
Doppler-shifted wavelength depending on its propagation direction, which
leads to a Doppler-shifted absorption and emission. This leads to a
different source function and a different $\Lambda$\^* operator in the
radiative transfer equations compared to the static case. 
Results: The results of the Eulerian 3D spherical calculations are
compared to our well-tested 1D Lagrangian spherical calculations, the
agreement is, up to vmax = 1 \texttimes{} 103 km
s-1 very good. Test calculation in other geometries are also

ELODIE is designed as an updated version of the cross-correlation spectrometer CORAVEL, to perform very accurate radial velocity measurements such as needed in the search, by Doppler shift, for brown-dwarfs or giant planets orbiting around nearby stars. In one single exposure a spectrum at a resolution of 42000 ($\lambda$/\{DELTA\}$\lambda$) ranging from 3906A to 6811A is recorded on a
1024x1024 CCD. This performance is achieved by using a tan\texttheta{}=4
echelle grating and a combination of a prism and a grism as
cross-disperser. An automatic on-line data treatment reduces all the ELODIE echelle spectra and computes cross-correlation functions. The instrument design and the data reduction algorithms are described in this paper. The efficiency and accuracy of the instrument and its long term instrumental stability allow us to measure radial velocities with an accuracy better than 15m/s for stars up to 9th magnitude in less than 30 minutes exposure time. Observations of 16th magnitude stars are also possible to measure velocities at about 1km/s accuracy. For classic spectroscopic studies (S/N$>$100) 9th magnitude stars can be observed in one hour exposure time.},

108147 orbits its parent star in 10.9 days and its minimum

eccentricity, e=0.50, indicating possibly the presence of a second
companion. The detection of Saturn-mass planets by means of the Doppler
technique demands high radial-velocity measurement precision. The two
new candidates were discovered by means of the CORALIE echelle
spectrograph. The instrumental accuracy of CORALIE combined with the
simultaneous ThAr-reference technique has reached a level better than 3
m s-1. On many observed objects the precision is now limited
by photon noise. We present in this paper the weighted cross-correlation
technique, which leads to an improvement in the photon noise of the
computed radial velocity. We discuss as well a modification of the
numerical cross-correlation mask which reduces significantly the
residual perturbation effects produced by telluric absorption lines.

  abstract = {The design and construction of CARMENES has been presented at previous 
SPIE conferences. It is a next-generation radial-velocity instrument at
the 3.5m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory, which was built by a
consortium of eleven Spanish and German institutions. CARMENES consists
of two separate \'echelle spectrographs covering the wavelength
range from 0.52 to 1.71$\mu$m at a spec-tral resolution of R $<$ 80,000,
fed by fibers from the Cassegrain focus of the telescope. CARMENES saw
"First Light" on Nov 9, 2015. During the commissioning and initial
operation phases, we established basic performance data such as
throughput and spectral resolution. We found that our hollow-cathode
lamps are suitable for precise wavelength calibration, but their spectra
contain a number of lines of neon or argon that are so bright that the
lamps cannot be used in simultaneous exposures with stars. We have
therefore adopted a calibration procedure that uses simultaneous star /
Fabry P\'erot etalon exposures in combination with a
cross-calibration between the etalons and hollow-cathode lamps during
daytime. With this strategy it has been possible to achieve 1-2 m/s
precision in the visible and 5-10 m/s precision in the near-IR; further
improvements are expected from ongoing work on temperature control,
calibration procedures and data reduction. Comparing the RV precision
achieved in different wavelength bands, we find a "sweet spot" between
0.7 and 0.8$\mu$m, where deep TiO bands provide rich RV information in
mid-M dwarfs. This is in contrast to our pre-survey models, which
predicted comparatively better performance in the near-IR around 1$\mu$m,
and explains in part why our near-IR RVs do not reach the same precision
level as those taken with the visible spectrograph. We are now
conducting a large survey of 340 nearby M dwarfs (with an average
distance of only 12pc), with the goal of finding terrestrial planets in
their habitable zones. We have detected the signatures of several
previously known or suspected planets and also discovered several new
planets. We find that the radial velocity periodograms of many M dwarfs
show several significant peaks. The development of robust methods to
distinguish planet signatures from activity-induced radial velocity
jitter is therefore among our priorities. Due to its large wavelength
coverage, the CARMENES survey is generating a unique data set for
studies of M star atmospheres, rotation, and activity. The spectra cover
important diagnostic lines for activity (H alpha, Na I D1 and D2, and
the Ca II infrared triplet), as well as FeH lines, from which the
magnetic field can be inferred. Correlating the time series of these
features with each other, and with wavelength-dependent radial
velocities, provides excellent handles for the discrimination between
planetary companions and stellar radial velocity jitter. These data are
also generating new insight into the physical properties of M dwarf
atmospheres, and the impact of activity and flares on the habitability
of M star planets.},

  abstract = {Context. New instrumental capabilities and the wealth of astrophysical information extractable from the near-infrared wavelength region have led to a growing interest in the field of high resolution spectroscopy at 1-5 $\mu$m. Aims: We aim to provide a library of observed
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise-ratio near-infrared spectra of stars of various types throughout the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This is needed for the exploration of spectral features in this wavelength range and for comparison of reference targets with observations and models. Methods: High quality spectra were obtained using the CRIRES near-infrared spectrograph at ESO's VLT covering the range from 0.97 $\mu$m to 5.3 $\mu$m at high spectral resolution. Accurate wavelength calibration and correction for telluric lines were performed by fitting synthetic transmission spectra for the Earth's atmosphere to each spectrum individually. Results: We describe the observational strategy and the current status and content of the library which includes 13 objects. The first examples of finally reduced spectra are presented. This publication will serve as a reference paper to introduce the library to the community and explore the extensive amount of material.

  abstract = {We report the results of the statistical analysis of planetary signals 
discovered in MOA-II microlensing survey alert system events from 2007
to 2012. We determine the survey sensitivity as a function of
planet-star mass ratio, q, and projected planet-star
separation, s, in Einstein radius units. We find that the mass-ratio
function is not a single power law, but has a change in slope at q \texttildelow{}
10-4, corresponding to \texttildelow{}20 M $\oplus$ for
the median host-star mass of \texttildelow{}0.6 \{M\}$\odot$ . We find
significant planetary signals in 23 of the 1474 alert events that are
well-characterized by the MOA-II survey data alone. Data from other
groups are used only to characterize planetary signals that have been
identified in the MOA data alone. The distribution of mass ratios and
separations of the planets found in our sample are well fit by a broken
power-law model of the form
\{\{dN\}\}\{pl\}/\{(d\{log\}qd\{log\}s)=A(q/\{q\}\{br\})\}n\{s\}m
\{\{dex\}\}-2 for q $>$ q br and
\{\{dN\}\}\{pl\}/\{(d\{log\}qd\{log\}s)=A(q/\{q\}\{br\})\}p\{s\}m
\{\{dex\}\}-2 for q $<$ q br, where q br
is the mass ratio of the break. We also combine this analysis with the
previous analyses of Gould et al. and Cassan et al., bringing the total
sample to 30 planets. This combined analysis yields
A=\{0.61\}-0.16+0.21, n = -0.93 $\pm$ 0.13,
m=\{0.49\}-0.49+0.47, and
p=\{0.6\}-0.4+0.5 for q br $\equiv$ 1.7
\texttimes{} 10-4. The unbroken power-law model is
disfavored with a p-value of 0.0022, which corresponds to a Bayes factor
of 27 favoring the broken power-law model. These results imply that cold
Neptunes are likely to be the most common type of planets beyond the
snow line.},

Furthermore, ground based transit searches now reach milli-mag photometric precision and can discover Neptune size planets around bright stars. These searches will find exoplanets around bright stars anywhere on the sky, their discoveries representing prime science targets for further study due to the proximity and brightness of their host stars. A mission for transit follow-up measurements of these prime targets is currently lacking. The first ESA S-class mission CHEOPS (CHaracterizing ExoPlanet Satellite) will fill this gap. It will perform ultra-high precision photometric monitoring of selected bright target stars almost anywhere on the sky with sufficient precision to detect Earth sized transits. It will be able to detect transits of RV-planets by photometric monitoring if the geometric configuration results in a transit. For Hot Neptunes discovered from the ground, CHEOPS will be able to improve the transit light curve so that the radius can be determined precisely. Because of the host stars' brightness, high precision RV measurements will be possible for all targets. All planets observed in transit by CHEOPS will be validated and their masses will be known. This will provide valuable data for constraining the mass-radius relation of exoplanets, especially in the Neptune-mass regime. During the planned 3.5 year mission, about 500 targets will be observed. There will be 20\% of open time available for the community to develop new science programmes.},

  abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg \textsuperscript{2}) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2 \%, 4-10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0 catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass, low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships. Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO 2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic science.},

  shorttitle = {Telluric Correction in the Near-Infrared},
  abstract = {Context. The atmospheric absorption of the Earth is an important limiting factor for ground-based spectroscopic observations and the near-infrared and infrared regions are the most affected. Several software packages that produce a synthetic atmospheric transmission spectrum have been developed to correct for the telluric absorption; these are Molecfit, TelFit, and TAPAS. Aims. Our goal is to compare the correction achieved using these three telluric correction packages and the division by a telluric standard star. We want to evaluate the best method to correct near-infrared high-resolution spectra as well as the limitations of each software package and methodology. Methods. We applied the telluric correction methods to CRIRES archival data taken in the J and K bands. We explored how the achieved correction level varies depending on the atmospheric T-P profile used in the modelling, the depth of the atmospheric lines, and the molecules creating the absorption. Results. We found that the Molecfit and TelFit corrections lead to smaller residuals for the water lines. The standard star method corrects best the oxygen lines. The Molecfit package and the standard star method corrections result in global offsets always below 0.5\% for all lines; the offset is similar with TelFit and TAPAS for the H2O lines and around 1\% for the O2 lines. All methods and software packages result in a scatter between 3\% and 7\% inside the telluric lines. The use of a tailored atmospheric profile for the observatory leads to a scatter two times smaller, and the correction level improves with lower values of precipitable water vapour. Conclusions. The synthetic transmission methods lead to an improved correction compared to the standard star method for the water lines in the J band with no loss of telescope time, but the oxygen lines were better corrected by the standard star method.},

  doi = {10/gffkrp},
  abstract = {Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectral analysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number of exoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1-1.7 micrometres). Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures.},

  abstract = {Obliquity variability could play an important role in the climate and habitability of a planet. Orbital modulations caused by planetary companions and the planet's spin axis precession due to the torque from the host star may lead to resonant interactions and cause large-amplitude obliquity variability. Here we consider the spin axis dynamics of Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f, both of which reside in the habitable zone around their host stars. Using N -body simulations and secular numerical integrations, we describe their obliquity evolution for particular realizations of the planetary systems. We then use a generalized analytic framework to characterize regions in parameter space where the obliquity is variable with large amplitude. We find that the locations of variability are fine-tuned over the planetary properties and system architecture in the lower-obliquity regimes ($\lessequivlnt$40$^\circ$). As an example, assuming a rotation period of 24 hr, the obliquities of both Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f are stable below $\sim$40$^\circ$, whereas the high-obliquity regions (60$^\circ$\textendash{}90$^\circ$) allow moderate variabilities. However, for some other rotation periods of Kepler-62f or Kepler-186f, the lower-obliquity regions could become more variable owing to resonant interactions. Even small deviations from coplanarity (e.g., mutual inclinations $\sim$3$^\circ$) could stir peak-to-peak obliquity variations up to $\sim$20$^\circ$. Undetected planetary companions and/or the existence of a satellite could also destabilize the low-obliquity regions. In all cases, the high-obliquity region allows for moderate variations, and all obliquities corresponding to retrograde motion (i.e., $>$90$^\circ$) are stable.},

For the HARPS data set, the most probable number of planetary signals detected is five with a Bayesian false alarm probability of 0.01. These include the 3.1498 $\pm$ 0.0005, 5.3687
$\pm$ 0.0002, 12.927+0.006- 0.004 and 66.9
$\pm$ 0.2 d periods reported previously plus a
399+14- 16 d period. Their orbital eccentricities are 0.0+0.2- 0.0, 0.00+0.02- 0.00, 0.10+0.06- 0.10,
0.33+0.09- 0.10 and 0.02+0.30- 0.01, respectively. The semimajor-axis and M sin i of the five planets are (0.0285 $\pm$ 0.0006 au, 1.9 $\pm$ 0.3
M$\oplus$), (0.0406 $\pm$ 0.0009 au, 15.7 $\pm$ 0.7
M$\oplus$), (0.073 $\pm$ 0.002 au, 5.3 $\pm$ 0.4
M$\oplus$), (0.218 $\pm$ 0.005 au, 6.7 $\pm$ 0.8
M$\oplus$) and (0.7 $\pm$ 0.2 au, 6.6+2.0-
2.7 M$\oplus$), respectively.

The analysis of the HIRES data set yielded a reliable detection of only the strongest 5.37 and 12.9 d periods. The analysis of the combined HIRES/HARPS data again only reliably detected the 5.37 and 12.9 d periods. The detection of four planetary signals with the periods of 3.15, 5.37, 12.9 and 66.9 d was only achieved by including an additional unknown but parametrized Gaussian error term added in quadrature to the HIRES quoted errors. The marginal distribution for the $\sigma$ of this additional error term has a well-defined peak at 1.8 $\pm$ 0.4 m
s-1. It is possible that this additional error arises from unidentified systematic effects. We did not find clear evidence for a fifth planetary signal in the combined HIRES/HARPS data set. Based on the available data, our analysis does not support the claimed detection of a sixth planet Gliese 581g.},

the 5.37-day, 12.9-day, 3.15-day, and 67-day planets previously
announced by Bonfils et al., Udry et al., and Mayor et al.. The
observations also indicate a fifth planet in the system, GJ 581f, a
minimum-mass 7.0 M $\oplus$ planet orbiting in a 0.758 AU
orbit of period 433 days, and a sixth planet, GJ 581g, a minimum-mass
3.1 M $\oplus$ planet orbiting at 0.146 AU with a period of
36.6 days. The estimated equilibrium temperature of GJ 581g is 228 K,
placing it squarely in the middle of the habitable zone of the star and
offering a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet
around a very nearby star. That a system harboring a potentially
habitable planet has been found this nearby, and this soon in the
relatively early history of precision RV surveys, indicates that
$\eta\oplus$, the fraction of stars with potentially
habitable planets, is likely to be substantial. This detection, coupled
with statistics of the incompleteness of present-day precision RV
surveys for volume-limited samples of stars in the immediate solar
neighborhood, suggests that $\eta\oplus$ could well be on the
order of a few tens of percent. If the local stellar neighborhood is a
representative sample of the galaxy as a whole, our Milky Way could be
teeming with potentially habitable planets.},

  abstract = {We re-examine the statistical confirmation of small long-period Kepler planet candidates in light of recent improvements in our understanding of the occurrence of systematic false alarms in this regime. Using the final Data Release 25 (DR25) Kepler planet candidate catalog statistics, we find that the previously confirmed single planet system Kepler-452b no longer achieves a 99\% confidence in the planetary hypothesis and is not considered statistically validated in agreement with the finding of Mullally et al. (2018). For multiple planet systems, we find that the planet prior enhancement for belonging to a multiple planet system is suppressed relative to previous Kepler catalogs, and we identify the multi-planet system member, Kepler-186f, no longer achieves a 99\% confidence in the planetary hypothesis. Because of the numerous
confounding factors in the data analysis process that leads to the detection and characterization of a signal, it is difficult to determine whether any one planetary candidate achieves a strict criterion for confirmation relative to systematic false alarms. For instance, when taking into account a simplified model of processing variations, the additional single planet systems Kepler-443b, Kepler-441b, Kepler-1633b, Kepler-1178b, and Kepler-1653b have a non-negligible probability of falling below a 99\% confidence in the planetary hypothesis. The
systematic false alarm hypothesis must be taken into account when employing statistical validation techniques in order to confirm planet candidates that approach the detection threshold of a survey. We encourage those performing transit searches of K2, TESS, and other similar data sets to quantify their systematic false alarms rates. Alternatively, independent photometric detection of the transit signal or radial velocity measurements can eliminate the false alarm
hypothesis.},

In this publication we outline the T-REx framework and demonstrate, using a theoretical hot-Jupiter transmission spectrum, the parameter retrieval and model selection. We investigate the impact of signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution on the retrievability of individual model parameters, both in terms of error bars on the temperature and molecular mixing ratios as well as its effect on the model's global Bayesian evidence.},

  abstract = {Context. The new CARMENES instrument comprises two high-resolution and 
high-stability spectrographs that are used to search for habitable
planets around M dwarfs in the visible and near-infrared regime via the
Doppler technique. Aims: Characterising our target sample is
important for constraining the physical properties of any planetary
systems that are detected. The aim of this paper is to determine the
fundamental stellar parameters of the CARMENES M-dwarf target sample
from high-resolution spectra observed with CARMENES. We also include
several M-dwarf spectra observed with other high-resolution
spectrographs, that is CAFE, FEROS, and HRS, for completeness. 
Methods: We used a $\chi$2 method to derive the stellar
parameters effective temperature Teff, surface gravity logg,
and metallicity [Fe/H] of the target stars by fitting the most recent
version of the PHOENIX-ACES models to high-resolution spectroscopic
data. These stellar atmosphere models incorporate a new equation of
state to describe spectral features of low-temperature stellar
atmospheres. Since Teff, logg, and [Fe/H] show degeneracies,
the surface gravity is determined independently using stellar
evolutionary models. Results: We derive the stellar parameters
for a total of 300 stars. The fits achieve very good agreement between
the PHOENIX models and observed spectra. We estimate that our method
provides parameters with uncertainties of $\sigma$Teff = 51 K,
$\sigma$log g = 0.07, and $\sigma$[Fe/H] = 0.16, and
show that atmosphere models for low-mass stars have significantly
improved in the last years. Our work also provides an independent test
of the new PHOENIX-ACES models, and a comparison for other methods using
low-resolution spectra. In particular, our effective temperatures agree
well with literature values, while metallicities determined with our
method exhibit a larger spread when compared to literature results.

  abstract = {Context. Being the most numerous and oldest stars in the galaxy, M dwarfs are objects of great interest for exoplanet searches. The presence of molecules in their atmosphere complicates our understanding of their atmospheric properties. But great advances have recently been made in the modeling of M dwarfs due to the revision of solar abundances. \\
 Aims: We aim to determine stellar parameters of M dwarfs using high resolution spectra (R \~ 90 000) simultaneously in the visible and the near-infrared. The high resolution spectra and broad wavelength coverage provide an unique opportunity to understand the onset of dust and cloud formation at cool temperatures. Furthermore, this study will help in understanding the physical processes which occur in a cool atmospheres, particularly, the redistribution of energy from the optical to the near-infrared. \\
 Methods: The stellar parameters of M dwarfs in our sample have been determined by comparing the high resolution spectra both in the optical and in the near-infrared simultaneously observed by CARMENES with the synthetic spectra obtained from the BT-Settl model atmosphere. The detailed spectral synthesis of these observed spectra both in the optical and in the near-infrared helps to understand the missing continuum opacity. \\
 Results: For the first time, we derive fundamental stellar parameters of M dwarfs using the high resolution optical and near-infrared spectra simultaneously. We determine T\textsubscript{eff}, log g and [M/H] for 292 M dwarfs of spectral type M0 to M9, where the formation of dust and clouds are important. The derived T\textsubscript{eff} for the sample ranges from 2300 to 4000 K, values of log g ranges from 4.5 $\leq$ logg $\leq$ 5.5 and the resulting metallicity ranges from -0.5 $\leq$ [M/H] $\leq$ +0.5. We have also explored the possible differences in T\textsubscript{eff}, log g and [M/H] by comparing them with other studies of the same sample of M dwarfs.

  abstract = {Comparisons between the planet populations around solar-type stars and those orbiting M dwarfs shed light on the possible dependence of planet formation and evolution on stellar mass. However, such analyses must control for other factors, i.e., metallicity, a stellar parameter that strongly influences the occurrence of gas giant planets. We obtained infrared spectra of 121 M dwarfs stars monitored by the California Planet Search and determined metallicities with an accuracy of 0.08 dex. The mean and standard deviation of the sample are -0.05 and 0.20 dex, respectively. We parameterized the metallicity dependence of the occurrence of giant planets on orbits with a period less than two years around solar-type stars and applied this to our M dwarf sample to estimate the expected number of giant planets. The number of detected planets (3) is lower than the predicted number (6.4), but the difference is not very significant (12\% probability of finding as many or fewer planets). The three M dwarf planet hosts are not especially metal rich and the most likely value of the power-law index relating planet occurrence to metallicity is 1.06 dex per dex for M dwarfs compared to 1.80 for solar-type stars; this difference, however, is comparable to uncertainties. Giant planet occurrence around both types of stars allows, but does not necessarily require, a mass dependence of \textasciitilde{}1 dex per dex. The actual planet-mass-metallicity relation may be complex, and elucidating it will require larger surveys like those to be conducted by ground-based infrared spectrographs and the Gaia space astrometry mission.},

We performed numerous tests in which we applied TODCOR to simulated spectra which were prepared as combinations of two spectra with various luminosity ratios, together with random noise. These tests show that TODCOR can detect a very faint secondary spectrum and measure correctly its velocity, even with a luminosity ratio of 1000, provided the combined spectrum has enough spectral coverage and highS / N. Measuring the radial velocity of the faint secondary will enable us to estimate the companion mass, a very useful tool in the search for brown dwarfs and giant planets around nearby stars.},

tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the

For systems with M(2)/M(1) not greater than 0.1, the proportion of brown
dwarf companions among the IAU velocity standards is estimated at 10
percent of the primaries, a value in good agreement with that found in

  abstract = {Current spectroscopic techniques yield Doppler-shift errors of 10 to 50 m s\^-1, barely adequate to detect reflex velocities caused by
Jupiter-like and lower-mass planets. We describe a technique which yields relative radial velocity errors of 3 m s\^-1. This technique makes use of a fast echelle spectrograph at resolution of R=62,000 and a large format CCD which acquires the entire visible and near IR spectrum in each exposure. Starlight is sent through an iodine absorption cell placed at the spectrometer entrance slit. The resulting superimposed iodine lines provide a fiducial wavelength scale against which to measure radial velocity shifts. The shapes of iodine lines convey the PSF of the spectrometer to account for changes in spectrometer optics and illumination on all times scales. We construct a model of each observed spectrum by multiplying a stellar spectrum with an iodine spectrum and convolving the result with the spectrometer PSF. The free parameters of the model include the wavelength scale, spectrometer PSF, and stellar Doppler shift. All model parameters are derived anew for each exposure and the synthesis is done on a grid of CCD sub-pixels, using spline functions as interpolation predictors. We present Doppler tests of the Sun, Tau Ceti, and 107 Psc, observed with the Lick and Keck echelles. All exhibit apparent errors of about 3 m s\^-1, maintained on time scales of minutes to a year. This precision agrees with the theoretically predicted errors that stem primarily from photon
statistics. (SECTION: Astronomical Instrumentation)},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: \textbullet{} From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. \textbullet{} Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. \textbullet{} Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. \textbullet{} Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. \textbullet{} Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. \textbullet{} In ``nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. \textbullet{} The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. \textbullet{} When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. \textbullet{} Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. \textbullet{} Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. \textbullet{} It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

Extreme Precision Doppler Spectrometer instrument concept NEID

instrument performance budget is a necessity for both identifying the

estimating the achievable performance of next generation exoplanet
hunting Doppler spectrometers. For these instruments, no single source
of instrumental error is expected to set the overall measurement floor.
Rather, the overall instrumental measurement precision is set by the
contribution of many individual error sources. We use a combination of
numerical simulations, educated estimates based on published materials,
extrapolations of physical models, results from laboratory measurements
of spectroscopic subsystems, and informed upper limits for a variety of
error sources to identify likely sources of systematic error and
construct our global instrument performance error budget. While natively
focused on the performance of the NEID instrument, this modular
performance budget is immediately adaptable to a number of current and
future instruments. Such an approach is an important step in charting a
path towards improving Doppler measurement precisions to the levels
necessary for discovering Earth-like planets.},

A digital filtering technique using the fast Fourier transform and low-pass filters was used to smooth the selected data and to separate the seasonal cycle from the long-term increase in CO\textsubscript{2}. The amplitude of the seasonal cycle was found to be increasing at a rate of 0.05$\pm$0.02 ppm yr\textsuperscript{-1}. The average growth rate of CO\textsubscript{2} was 1.42$\pm$0.02 ppm yr\textsuperscript{-1}, and the fraction of CO\textsubscript{2} remaining in the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion was 59\%. A comparison between the Mauna Loa continuous CO\textsubscript{2} data and the CO\textsubscript{2} flask sample data from the sea level site at Cape Kumukahi, Hawaii, showed that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle at Cape Kumukahi was 23\% larger than at Mauna Loa, with the phase of the cycle at Mauna Loa lagging the cycle at Cape Kumukahi by about 1-2 weeks.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) and methane (CH\textsubscript{4}) are the two most important anthropogenic greenhouse gases. SCIAMACHY on ENVISAT is the first satellite instrument whose measurements are sensitive to concentration changes of the two gases at all altitude levels down to the Earth's surface where the source/sink signals are largest. We have processed three years (2003-2005) of SCIAMACHY near-infrared nadir measurements to simultaneously retrieve vertical columns of CO\textsubscript{2} (from the 1.58 $\mu$m absorption band), CH\textsubscript{4} (1.66 $\mu$m) and oxygen (O\textsubscript{2} A-band at 0.76 $\mu$m) using the scientific retrieval algorithm WFM-DOAS. We show that the latest version of WFM-DOAS, version 1.0, which is used for this study, has been significantly improved with respect to its accuracy compared to the previous versions while essentially maintaining its high processing speed (\textasciitilde{}1 min per orbit, corresponding to \textasciitilde{}6000 single measurements, and per gas on a standard PC). The greenhouse gas columns are converted to dry air column-averaged mole fractions, denoted XCO\textsubscript{2} (in ppm) and XCH\textsubscript{4} (in ppb), by dividing the greenhouse gas columns by simultaneously retrieved dry air columns. For XCO\textsubscript{2} dry air columns are obtained from the retrieved O\textsubscript{2} columns. For XCH\textsubscript{4} dry air columns are obtained from the retrieved CO\textsubscript{2} columns because of better cancellation of light path related errors compared to using O\textsubscript{2} columns retrieved from the spectrally distant O\textsubscript{2} A-band. Here we focus on a discussion of the XCH\textsubscript{4} data set. The XCO\textsubscript{2} data set is discussed in a separate paper (Part 1). For 2003 we present detailed comparisons with the TM5 model which has been optimally matched to highly accurate but sparse methane surface observations. After accounting for a systematic low bias of \textasciitilde{}2\% agreement with TM5 is typically within 1-2\%. We investigated to what extent the SCIAMACHY XCH\textsubscript{4} is influenced by the variability of atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} using global CO\textsubscript{2} fields from NOAA's CO\textsubscript{2} assimilation system CarbonTracker. We show that the CO\textsubscript{2} corrected and uncorrected XCH\textsubscript{4} spatio-temporal pattern are very similar but that agreement with TM5 is better for the CarbonTracker CO\textsubscript{2} corrected XCH\textsubscript{4}. In line with previous studies (e.g., Frankenberg et al., 2005b) we find higher methane over the tropics compared to the model. We show that tropical methane is also higher when normalizing the CH\textsubscript{4} columns with retrieved O\textsubscript{2} columns instead of CO\textsubscript{2}. In consistency with recent results of Frankenberg et al. (2008b) it is shown that the magnitude of the retrieved tropical methane is sensitive to the choice of the spectroscopic line parameters of water vapour. Concerning inter-annual variability we find similar methane spatio-temporal pattern for 2003 and 2004. For 2005 the retrieved methane shows significantly higher variability compared to the two previous years, most likely due to somewhat larger noise of the spectral measurements.},

As the day-to-day variations of amount of ozone in middle latitudes are large, it would be difficult to find without prolonged observation whether there is any systematic difference between the ozone amounts during day- and night-hours. In low latitudes, however, both the total amount as well as the day-to-day variations are small during a large part of the year, and if a regular daily variation exists as might be expected from the photochemical theory of atmospheric ozone, it could be determined from a short series of observations. Accordingly, observations were made at Mount Abu and Ahmedabad in the period November 1952-April 1953, and these show clearly that there is a substantial increase of ozone during night-hours, as compared to day-hours.},

The formation mechanism of this system is unknown, but the orbits can be stabilised when tidal dissipation is taken into account.

  abstract = {Despite the existence of co-orbital bodies in the solar system, and the prediction of the formation of co-orbital planets by planetary system formation models, no co-orbital exoplanets (also called trojans) have been detected thus far. Here we study the signature of co-orbital exoplanets in transit surveys when two planet candidates in the system orbit the star with similar periods. Such pair of candidates could be discarded as false positives because they are not Hill-stable. However, horseshoe or long libration period tadpole co-orbital configurations can explain such period similarity. This degeneracy can be solved by considering the Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) of each planet. We then focus on the three planet candidates system TOI-178: the two outer candidates of that system have similar orbital period and had an angular separation near \$$\backslash$pi/3\$ during the TESS observation of sector 2. Based on the announced orbits, the long-term stability of the system requires the two close-period planets to be co-orbitals. Our independent detrending and transit search recover and slightly favour the three orbits close to a 3:2:2 resonant chain found by the TESS pipeline, although we cannot exclude an alias that would put the system close to a 4:3:2 configuration. We then analyse in more detail the co-orbital scenario. We show that despite the influence of an inner planet just outside the 2:3 mean-motion resonance, this potential co-orbital system can be stable on the Giga-year time-scale for a variety of planetary masses, either on a trojan or a horseshoe orbit. We predict that large TTVs should arise in such configuration with a period of several hundred days. We then show how the mass of each planet can be retrieved from these TTVs.},

  abstract = {Stellar systems consisting of multiple stars tend to undergo tidal interactions when the separations between the stars are short. While tidal phenomena have been extensively studied, a certain tidal effect exclusive to hierarchical triples (triples in which one component star has a much wider orbit than the others) has hardly received any attention, mainly due to its complexity and consequent resistance to being modelled. This tidal effect is the tidal perturbation of the tertiary by the inner binary, which in turn depletes orbital energy from the inner binary, causing the inner binary separation to shrink. In this paper, we develop a fully numerical simulation of these ‘tertiary tides' by modifying established tidal models. We also provide general insight as to how close a hierarchical triple needs to be in order for such an effect to take place, and demonstrate that our simulations can effectively retrieve the orbital evolution for such systems.

  abstract = {The size of a planet is an observable property directly connected to the physics of its formation and evolution. We used precise radius measurements from the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) to study the size distribution of 2025 \$$\backslash$textit\{Kepler\}\$ planets in fine detail. We detect a factor of \$$\backslash$geq\$2 deficit in the occurrence rate distribution at 1.5-2.0 R\$\_\{$\backslash$oplus\}\$. This gap splits the population of close-in (\$P\$ $<$ 100 d) small planets into two size regimes: R\$\_P\$ $<$ 1.5 R\$\_\{$\backslash$oplus\}\$ and R\$\_P\$ = 2.0-3.0 R\$\_\{$\backslash$oplus\}\$, with few planets in between. Planets in these two regimes have nearly the same intrinsic frequency based on occurrence measurements that account for planet detection efficiencies. The paucity of planets between 1.5 and 2.0 R\$\_\{$\backslash$oplus\}\$ supports the emerging picture that close-in planets smaller than Neptune are composed of rocky cores measuring 1.5 R\$\_\{$\backslash$oplus\}\$ or smaller with varying amounts of low-density gas that determine their total sizes.},

  abstract = {[Abridged] The Study Analysis Group 8 of the NASA Exoplanet Analysis Group was convened to assess the current capabilities and the future potential of the precise radial velocity (PRV) method to advance the NASA goal to "search for planetary bodies and Earth-like planets in orbit around other stars.: (U.S. National Space Policy, June 28, 2010). PRVs complement other exoplanet detection methods, for example offering a direct path to obtaining the bulk density and thus the structure and composition of transiting exoplanets. Our analysis builds upon previous community input, including the ExoPlanet Community Report chapter on radial velocities in 2008, the 2010 Decadal Survey of Astronomy, the Penn State Precise Radial Velocities Workshop response to the Decadal Survey in 2010, and the NSF Portfolio Review in 2012. The radial-velocity detection of exoplanets is strongly endorsed by both the Astro 2010 Decadal Survey "New Worlds, New Horizons" and the NSF Portfolio Review, and the community has recommended robust investment in PRVs. The demands on telescope time for the above mission support, especially for systems of small planets, will exceed the number of nights available using instruments now in operation by a factor of at least several for TESS alone. Pushing down towards true Earth twins will require more photons (i.e. larger telescopes), more stable spectrographs than are currently available, better calibration, and better correction for stellar jitter. We outline four hypothetical situations for PRV work necessary to meet NASA mission exoplanet science objectives.},

  abstract = {Stellar heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmospheres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature\textemdash{}neutral hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths\textemdash{}is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 $\pm$ 0.05\%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet's upper atmosphere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of $\lessequivlnt$3 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{5} grams per second. A net blue-shift of the absorption might be explained by high-altitude winds flowing at 3 kilometers per second from day to night-side.},

  abstract = {Brown dwarfs are the coolest class of stellar objects known to date. Our present perception is that brown dwarfs follow the principles of star formation, and that brown dwarfs share many characteristics with planets. Being the darkest and lowest mass stars known makes brown dwarfs also the coolest stars known. This has profound implication for their spectral fingerprints. Brown dwarfs cover a range of effective temperatures which cause brown dwarfs atmospheres to be a sequence that gradually changes from a M-dwarf-like spectrum into a planet-like spectrum. This further implies that below an effective temperature of 2,800 K, clouds form already in atmospheres of objects marking the boundary between M-Dwarfs and brown dwarfs. Recent developments have sparked the interest in plasma processes in such very cool atmospheres: sporadic and quiescent radio emission has been observed in combination with decaying X-ray activity indicators across the fully convective boundary.},

  abstract = {We present Spitzer 7.6-14.5 $\mu$m spectra of ULAS J003402.77-005206.7 and ULAS J133553.45+113005.2, two T9 dwarfs with the latest spectral types currently known. We fit synthetic spectra and photometry to the near- through mid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the T8 dwarf 2MASS J09393548-2448279. We also analyze near-infrared data for another T9, CFBD J005910.82-011401.3. We find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infrared fluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures, and that the 2.2 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity; increasing gravity has a similar effect to decreasing metallicity, and vice versa, and there is a degeneracy between these parameters. The 4.5 $\mu$m and 10 $\mu$m fluxes are also sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which we find to be significant for these dwarfs. The full near- through mid-infrared spectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature (K)/gravity (ms\textsuperscript{-2})/metallicity ([m/H] dex) of ULAS J0034-00 and ULAS J1335+11 to 550-600/100-300/0.0-0.3 and 500-550/100-300/0.0-0.3, respectively. These fits imply low masses and young ages for the dwarfs of 5-20 M \textsubscript{Jupiter} and 0.1-2 Gyr. The fits to 2MASS J0939-24 are in good agreement with the measured distance, the observational data, and the earlier T8 near-infrared spectral type if it is a slightly metal-poor 4-10 Gyr old system consisting of a 500 K and 700 K, \textasciitilde{}25 M \textsubscript{Jupiter} and \textasciitilde{}40 M \textsubscript{Jupiter}, pair, although it is also possible that it is an identical pair of 600 K, 30 M \textsubscript{Jupiter}, dwarfs. As no mid-infrared data are available for CFBD J0059-01 its properties are less well constrained; nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600 K dwarf with g= 300-2000 ms\textsuperscript{-2} and [m/H] = 0-0.3 dex. These properties correspond to mass and age ranges of 10-50 M \textsubscript{Jupiter} and 0.5-10 Gyr for this dwarf.},
